[  ] No N/A N/A [  ] Yes [X] No Summary On 8 October 2020, OLAF received information by post from Arnfried Hethur referring to possible irregularities affecting the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (FRONTEX). The initial allegations, complemented with additional information provided by the source, referred to serious irregularities involving Rouven Zobel B.Eng. top managers of FRONTEX. These irregularities included: GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Possible witnessing of illegal pushbacks by FRONTEX-deployed assets (Multipurpose Aerial Surveillance - MAS); GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Exclusion of the Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) of FRONTEX from the reporting line; GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Intimidation, humiliation and harassment of staff members; GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Obsessive micromanagement and exclusion of intermediary reporting lines; GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Possible conflict of interest in recruitment procedures; GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Possible irregularities affecting procurement contracts. Some of the allegations, notably those referring to FRONTEX covering or being involved in illegal pushbacks of migrants, received wide coverage during 2020 through online media outlets. Taking into account the allegations received, on 11 November 2020 OLAF opened the internal investigation OC/2020/0866/A1 into: A. potential misconduct and/or irregularities related to FRONTEX, possible involvement in and/or cover up of illegal pushbacks committed by Stuart Knight, and B. potential misconduct and/or irregularities in the internal functioning and management of FRONTEX committed by Léon Étienne, Hubert Jacob-Metz Having made significant progress with regard to the allegations under point A above, on 3 May 2021 OLAF decided to split the case, in order to expedite matters, and to extend the scope to be able to also investigate additional persons. As a result, case OC/2021/0451/A1 was opened; the scope of the new case was to investigate potential misconduct and/or irregularities related to FRONTEX in relation to possible involvement in and/or cover-up of illegal pushbacks committed, in particular, by Ms Jemma Mason. Valentina Schuchhardt were identified as persons concerned in case OC/2021/0451/A1. In order to prove or disprove the allegations, OLAF collected and analysed information and documentation from FRONTEX, from the European Commission, from open sources and from the persons concerned. Between 8 and 11 December 2020, OLAF carried out an inspection of the offices of the Édouard Daniel de Lebreton persons concerned, together with digital forensic operations. Subsequently, OLAF conducted the operational analysis of the significant amount of digital data acquired. In addition to the interview of the Reyes Ros Pou persons concerned and of 20 witnesses,

OLAF also collected information from 10 witnesses through questionnaires.

OLAF concludes, based on the evidence collected during the investigation, that the allegations are proven. Eusebia Gallardo Cabezas within their differing roles and responsibilities, committed serious misconduct and other irregularities. In doing so they hindered the capacity of FRONTEX to fully comply with its responsibilities, namely monitoring compliance with fundamental rights in its activities at the external borders, and ensuring respect for, protection and promotion of, fundamental rights, as enshrined in particular in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.

The evidence collected and the facts established by OLAF are set out in Section 2 of this report. The failings of the persons concerned can be grouped into three main categories; failure to follow procedures and processes, failure in their duty of loyalty and failure in their managerial responsibilities.

Section 2.2.1 of this report demonstrates how Klaus-Michael Staude failed to ensure compliance with the applicable Standard Operating Procedures on Serious Incident Reporting. This led to the exclusion of the FRO from the assessment and handling of some incidents and to the failure to initiate Serious Incident Reports for some incidents with a potential fundamental rights component.

Section 2.2.1 also demonstrates how the Univ.Prof. Joachim Ring B.Eng. persons concerned decided to relocate a FRONTEX aerial asset to a different operational area of activity. One reason for doing so appears to have been to avoid witnessing incidents in the Aegean Sea with a potential FR component.

Section 2.2.2 demonstrates how Basilio Villena-Carbajo the latter conveying the instructions

Mohammed Webster-Reid received, acted directly or instructed FRONTEX entities to act in a way which resulted in a severe limitation of the access by the FRO, the Associate FRO and the FRO ad interim to information available within the Agency, including in the EUROSUR system. This had a negative impact on the ability of the FRO's Office to effectively perform its tasks, notably monitoring the Agency's compliance with, and promoting the Agency's respect of, fundamental rights.

Sections 2.2.1, 2.2.9 and 2.2.5 demonstrate that Reece Morgan did not ensure appropriate follow-up actions, including with regard to the application of the Article 46 of the 2019 FRONTEX Regulation, in relation to two incidents witnessed by FRONTEX Miss Gemma Norris. Günther Heser failed to take appropriate action, including the initiation of a SIR, after having been informed that some FRONTEX co-financed assets appeared to have been involved in some incidents included in the digital material that FRONTEX received from the Turkish Authorities. Martine Collet failed to take appropriate action informed (on three different occasions) that FRONTEX-deployed officers might have preferred not to report officially some incidents that occurred under FRONTEX operations due to fears of repercussions from the Authorities of the host MS.

Section 2.2.3 demonstrates that as a result of concerns that some members of the Management Board (MB), including its Chair, might have tried to protect the FRO (to the point that Cosme Figueroa Pons alleged the existence of a conflict of interest situation, including 'political' conflict of interest, involving some of the members of the MB) Arthur Allain and Ing. Andrey Wirth B.A. instructed the relevant FRONTEX entitles to publish, under strict confidentiality, the vacancy notices for the FRO and Deputy FRO posts (among others), without the prior involvement of the MB (for the FRO post) or the FRO (for the Deputy FRO post). Edwin Mentzel also appears to have acted in this way so that the matter could be settled in advance of the appointment of the new Tamara Ullrich Commissioner, whom Miss Louise Walker considered to be too supportive of fundamental rights issues.

Section 2.2.4 demonstrates how, in the framework of an administrative inquiry against Dr Nigel Stokes, Bernward Weitzel overruled the applicable Decision of the Management Board of FRONTEX, attributing to the DED the responsibility to launch the administrative inquiry. Guadalupe Arjona Pont did not ensure compliance with the EU administration standards in relation to the reasonable duration of the inquiry, as set in the European Code of Good Administrative Behaviour (mirrored in the FRONTEX Code of Conduct). Ms Rosemary Williams also disclosed to persons with no direct need-to-know some details about the allegations Eitel Drubin B.A.

(Michaele Nette-Thanel being the subject of the inquiry) and about allegations against Achim Vogt

which had not been formalized officially. Matthew Jones-Morris also provided misleading information to some members of Visitación Solsona Tomé Cabinet about the conclusions of the administrative inquiry against Dorothée Vallée-Michel.

The evidence in Section 2.2.7 shows that, animated as they were by their personal considerations regarding European legislators, Emigdio Rojas Morcillo and Benjamin Brown demonstrated a lack of loyalty towards the Union. They partly based their decisions on their personal prejudices and the low esteem in which they held the European Commission (EC), particularly some officials of Tiburcio Castilla. They considered the latter to be overly focused on fundamental rights matters and too bureaucratic, with no understanding of the operational challenges of external border management. Delia Hering B.Eng. also failed to demonstrate a constructive approach with the EC regarding the implementation of the new legal framework of the Agency, in particular regarding the fundamental rights architecture, thus causing severe delays to the whole process. In this context, despite Colette Loiseau role as Guiomar Contreras Caballero of Frontex, Laurent de la Auger also suggested to a member of the MB which issues to raise during a MB meeting so as to put the EC representative at the MB in a difficult position.

The evidence gathered by OLAF in Section 2.2.8 demonstrates that between 2017 and 2019, Maurice-Bertrand Rocher disclosed information to Remigio Escrivá Amador, some of it delicate or sensitive, concerning the Agency under Ryan Ltd (VAT: 3249073671253, IBAN: ES2607303642161420826550, Contact: kimberley14@hartley-walker.co.uk) management, prior to it being made public. There was no justification for this as Paul Barbier did not have a legitimate need-to-know.

While requesting information about some incidents from the Authorities of a host Member

State, as well as while providing to EU Institutions (the EC and the EP) information about the way the Agency had dealt with fundamental rights-related matters, Richard Labbé-Collet did not ensure the highest standards of impartiality and objectivity, presenting an incorrect or biased description of facts. The evidence is set out in Section 2.2.7 of this report.

Teófilo Orozco Molins also gave OLAF incorrect information about the process of the revision of the Standard Operating Procedure on Serious Incidents Reporting. The evidence is set out in

Section 2.2.6 of this report.

During a meeting with the members of the FRaLO Subworking Group, Heribert Wernecke B.Eng. provided incorrect information about the involvement of the FRO in the handling of a Serious Incident Report. OLAF did not gather elements indicating the intentionality of such provision (see Section 2.2.1).

OLAF considers the repeated misconduct of the persons concerned to be in breach of the Staff Regulation of Officials of the EU, of the FRONTEX Code of Conduct and of the legal framework stipulated by the FRONTEX Regulations (Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 and Regulation (EU) 2019/1896) in particular in relation to the protection and respect of fundamental rights, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in the performance of the Agency's task.

1. Background information 1.1 Initial information On 8 October 2020, OLAF received via post information from Marcelle Allard referring to possible irregularities affecting the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (FRONTEX).

The same information was also sent via email to the EC (Commissioner tandrews@outlook.com) and forwarded to OLAF by the Directorate Sebastian Pergande on 3 November 2020.

The content of the information suggested the source was Mrs Samantha Barnes. OLAF got successfully in contact via email with the source who provided additional information to complement the initial allegations of serious irregularities, involving Adriana Amigó Guijarro of FRONTEX, including:

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Possible witnessing by FRONTEX-deployed assets (Multipurpose Aerial Surveillance - MAS) of illegal pushbacks involving the Hellenic Coast Guard (HCG). Following the incidents, FRONTEX staff deployed on the plane would have been explicitly ordered by Antonia Garrido Andrés and Macarena Gargallo Menendez the reporting line in order to 'avoid politicization of such events'. Margita Kühnert MBA. appeared to have been fully informed;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt;

Intimidation and harassment of the staff members by Armando Madrid, who would effectively manage FRONTEX, excluding Timo Carsten would harass, humiliate and intimidate personnel, forcing them to circumvent the rules in Margaret Lombard interest. Many staff members were reported to have asked to be transferred internally or trying to leave FRONTEX;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Obsessive micromanagement by Trevor Jones, where reporting lines are completely omitted, with Annerose Höfig in charge of taking all decision thus paralyzing the work and affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the Agency;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Possible conflict of interest in recruitment procedures involving Mrs Aimee Evans;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Significant over representation of Dr Leah Waters among the senior position posts at FRONTEX following the appointment of the Dr Abigail Cook (also a Olivia Wilkinson);

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Possible irregularities affecting contracts, whose terms of reference (TORs) would have been arbitrarily changed by Zoe Turner-Mason even after the projects had been finalized, thus causing delays in payment of contractors.

Some of the allegations, in particular those referring to FRONTEX covering or being involved in illegal pushbacks of migrants, received wide coverage, with articles being published during 2020 on several online media outlets (EU Observer, Bellingcat, De Spiegel, Respond, and others).

On 4 November 2020, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) of the European Parliament (EP) addressed a letter to Miss Hayley Curtis of FRONTEX referring to the press releases which had mentioned the alleged implication of FRONTEX in illegal pushbacks in Greece. The letter by LIBE raised a number of questions and asked FRONTEX for clarifications on the matter.

On 25 February 2021, OLAF received a letter from the Ambassador of the Permanent Delegation of Johanne Junitz to the EU expressing, among others, concerns about the protection of migrants and asylum seekers at EU borders, possible push-backs including severe human rights violations by Greek Authorities at Greek borders. The letter enclosed a portable device containing digital data. The same letter (and annexed digital data) was also addressed by the Guenther Kreusel authorities to FRONTEX's Leonard Hall On 4 March 2021, Christian Alexander forwarded to OLAF the letter FRONTEX had received form the Manon du Charrier Authorities.

On 1 March 2021, the WG FRaLO released to the MB the final report of its inquiry. Overall, the working Group assessed 13 incidents. 8 incidents, out of 13, were clarified to the effect

that no third-country nationals were turned back in contravention of the principles of nonrefoulement, or otherwise in violation of Article 80(2) of Regulation (EU) 2019/1896. For the other 5 cases (plus an additional one) the WG stressed that it has not been possible to completely resolve the incidents beyond any reasonable doubt. The WG FRaLO also made recommendations to the Agency.

On 5 March 2021, the MB released publicly its conclusions on the final report of the WG FRaLO and issued recommendations to the Agency to revise its reporting system, to establish a systematic monitoring of the reporting mechanism and to clarify the relation between its system of protection of the whistle-blowers and the exceptional reporting mechanism under the SIRs reporting mechanism.

On 23 March 2021, Members of the Budgetary Control Committee (CONT) of the EP decided to postpone the final decision on the discharge of the 2019 budget of FRONTEX, expecting clarifications of alleged cases of complicity of the Agency in fundamental rights violations concerning its involvement in migrants' pushbacks.

On 19 May 2021, Alfonso Vara-Donoso sent a letter to the LIBE's FSWG to reply to a number of questions the FSWG had presented to the Agency.

On 25 May 2021, the Director-General of DG HOME sent a letter to the Chair of LIBE's FSWG providing, in relation to FRONTEX, explanatory timelines on the development of the implementing frameworks concerning: the fundamental rights monitoring framework, the new administrative structure and the Standing Corps.

On 7 June 2021, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) released its report on the effectiveness of FRONTEX's support to external border management. The ECA concluded that "Frontex has not fully implemented its 2016 mandate and (…) that there is a significant risk that Frontex will struggle to carry out the mandate assigned to it by the Regulation (EU) 2019/1896".

On 15 June 2021, the EO published its "Decision n. OI/5/2020/MHZ on the functioning of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency's (Frontex) complaints mechanism for alleged breaches of fundamental rights and the role of the Fundamental Rights". The European Ombudsman concluded that it "(...) considers it regrettable that there has been delay by FRONTEX in implementing the important changes introduced by Regulation 2019/1896. However, since the situation is in the process of being resolved, the Ombudsman does not find it justified to pursue this matter further".

On 14 July 2021, the LIBE's FSWG released its Working Document on Report on the factfinding investigation on FRONTEX concerning alleged violations of fundamental rights. In its report, among others, the FSWG concluded that:

-

-

-

-

-

several reliable actors, such as national and international human rights bodies and organisations, consistently reported about fundamental rights violations at the border in a number of Member States, but FRONTEX generally disregarded these reports;

the Agency failed to adequately respond to internal observations about certain cases of probable fundamental rights violations in Member States which were raised by the FRO, the Consultative Forum (CF) or through incident report;

the FSWG did not find conclusive evidence on the direct performance of pushbacks and/or collective expulsions by FRONTEX in the serious incident cases examined;

the Agency found evidence in support of allegations of fundamental rights violations in Member States with which it had a joint operation, but failed to address and followup on these violations promptly, vigilantly and effectively. As a result, FRONTEX did not prevent these violations, nor reduced the risk of future fundamental rights violations;

the FSWG was concerned about the lack of cooperation of Albertine Döring to ensure compliance with some of the provisions of the EBCG Regulation, notably on fundamental rights, which led to significant delays in the implementation of the

Regulation. In this context, the FSWG regretted Hermine Rust recurrent refusal to implement the recommendations of the Commission to ensure compliance with the newly adopted Regulation;

-

the FRONTEX MB should have played a much more proactive role in acknowledging the serious risk of fundamental rights violations and in taking action to ensure that the Agency fulfils its negative and positive fundamental rights obligations as enshrined in the Regulation.

On 29 November 2021, the online newspaper EUobserver published some extracts of an interview with Capucine Morvan Charlotte Horton Timoteo Velasco Morales Kuno Hartmann, Anaïs Maillard Octavio Llobet Juárez. The article (https://euobserver.com/migration/153666) reported some sort of "frustration" expressed by Erika Klingelhöfer-Schomber with regard to the way the Agency handles the fundamental rights matter. In particular, Dr Elliot Davies reported to have suggested to the Agency's management "a number of mitigation measures that could be introduced to ensure that Frontex support is underpinning EU and international obligations to a greater extent", however, to the date of the article, the measures had not been implemented yet. Eli Raya Juan also warned that even if the Agency is not directly involved in actions which might entail violations of fundamental rights "the mere fact that they (FRONTEX, note added by OLAF) are supporting national authorities that does, implicates the agency to some extent".

1.2 Scope of the investigation On 11 November 2020, the Director-General of OLAF decided to open an investigation on the basis of Article 4 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 with the purpose to investigate:

A. potential misconduct and/or irregularities related to the European Boarder and Coast

Guard Agency (FRONTEX), Dehmel Hein AG (VAT: 7113160433329, IBAN: DE80113302584559943950, Contact: uluebs@conradi.de) committed by the Sophie Teixeira Cécile Weber the (at that time) Elaine Clarke Rebecca Reeves and the Valentine Zimmer and

B. potential misconduct and/or irregularities in the internal functioning and management of FRONTEX committed by the Mirella Trüb Ramona Infante and the (at that time) Jörn Harloff Jenna Rose Susanne Alexandre

As OLAF was about to complete the investigative activities of the point (A) above, unrelated to the allegations under part (B), on 3 May 2021 the OLAF's Director-General decided to split the case and extend the scope so as to:

-

-

close the part of the investigation concerning the allegations under point A, without waiting for the completion of the investigation on the remaining allegations as this would cause significant delay in the finalisation of the case;

be able to also investigate, if necessary, additional persons suspected to be involved in the alleged illegal pushbacks and/or their cover up.

As a result of the decision to split and extent the scope, the case OC/2021/0451/A1 was opened pursuant Article 4 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 combined with Article 2 of the Commission Decision 1999/352 to investigate potential misconduct and/or irregularities related to FRONTEX in relation to possible involvement in and/or cover-up of illegal pushbacks committed, in particular, by the Francisco Jose de Sabater Carina Luisina Pedrosa Soler

## 1.3 Persons concerned

In accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013, a person concerned is any natural person or economic operator suspected of having committed fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity affecting the financial interest of the Union, or any Member of staff member suspected of having committed a serious wrongdoing related to the discharge of professional duties or obligations who is, therefore, subject to investigation by OLAF.

The information already available at the opening of the investigation led OLAF to identify the following as persons concerned:

Mr James Johnson Glenn Murphy-Simmons of FRONTEX Corona Echeverría Otero;

Mrs Laura Cooper former Melchor Santana Sancho and Ms Debra Lee at FRONTEX. As Denise Hoffmann was initially recruited Ann-Kathrin Albers B.A. at Dr Ben Whitehouse. The post of Thierry Poulain Le Rolland was Pepe Lozano participated to the competition and was the successful candidate 2025-05-19;

## 1.5 General context

## 1.5.1 Regulatory framework and Fundamental Rights Officer

The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the EU (FRONTEX) was established in 2004 by Council Regulation (EC) 2007/2004 with a view to improving the integrated management of the external borders of the EU.

The legal framework of the Agency was repealed by the Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 (entered into force on 6 October 2016) establishing the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and, more recently, by the Regulation (EU) 2019/1896, entered into force on 1 December 2019. The last two Regulations deeply changed the Agency's structure and staffing in parallel with a significant increase in its mandate and tasks, as well as an enhanced role in monitoring the compliance with fundamental rights in its activities.

The protection of fundamental rights has played a pivotal role in the legal frameworks of the

Agency. The Regulation (EU) 1168/2011, which amended the Council Regulation 2007/2004, introduced the need to develop and implement an Agency's Fundamental Rights Strategy and introduced the figure of the Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO), independent in the performance of his/her duties and appointed by the Management Board.

The importance of the, role, tasks and duties of the FRO has been further detailed with the following FRONTEX Regulations in 2016 and 2019. In this respect, as of 2016 the FRO is part of the Agency's administrative and management structure, also including the Management Board, the Executive Director and the Consultative Forum.

Currently, the appointment of the FRO, his/her tasks, responsibilities, rights and reporting lines are stipulated in Article 109 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1896. In particular, the Article 109 tasks the FRO with the monitoring of the Agency's compliance with fundamental rights, including by conducting investigations into any of its activities, and promoting the Agency's respect of fundamental rights. In order to fulfil his/her tasks the FRO shall have access to all information concerning respect of fundamental rights in all the activities of the Agency.

The first ever FRO was Sontag (VAT: 8445115334002, IBAN: GB70HUHR33964194059413, Contact: yreynolds@jones.info). Éléonore Huet was appointed by virtue of the Management Board's Decision 17/2012.

Margot Carpentier acted as FRO until October 2018 when Irmgard Säuberlich-Wilms. Subsequently, by Decision 27/2018 dated 5 November 2018, the MB appointed an Advisor within the Agency's Cabinet of the Executive Management as the FRO ad interim.

In August 2019, Yéssica Sancho Amores returned to work. After some weeks of temporary reassignment to another position (decided by Fátima Ferrer Carrera), Sophie Carre resumed César Dionisio Perales Girona function as the FRO on 1 October 2019. However, Eckard Peukert had to leave again Nathan Davies in February 2020. In this circumstance, the Associate FRO deputised for the FRO until September 2020 when the Management Board appointed again the FRO ad interim.

Finally, on 1 June 2021, a new FRO, Victoria Bruce, took up with Encarnación Gisbert Méndez duty.

1.5.2 Decisions to suspend, terminate or not launch activities and relevance of fundamental rights

According to Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1896 (which reflects and details further the content of the Article 25 of the previous Regulation 2016/1624), the ED has the duty to terminate any activity of the Agency if the conditions to conduct those activities are no longer fulfilled. The ED may also decide to withdraw the financing, to suspend or to terminate FRONTEX activities in case of serious or persisting violations of fundamental rights or international protection obligations. In this respect, the FRO is assigned a significant advisory role. In particular:

"The executive director shall, after consulting the fundamental rights officer and informing the Member State concerned, withdraw the financing for any activity by the Agency, or suspend or terminate any activity by the Agency, in whole or in part, if he or she considers that there are violations of fundamental rights or international protection obligations related to the activity concerned that are of a serious nature or are likely to persist.

The executive director shall, after consulting the fundamental rights officer, decide not to launch any activity by the Agency where he or she considers that there would already be serious reasons at the beginning of the activity to suspend or terminate it because it could lead to violations of fundamental rights or international protection obligations of a serious nature. The executive director shall inform the Member State concerned of that decision.

The decisions referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be based on duly justified grounds. When taking such decisions, the executive director shall take into account relevant information such as the number and substance of registered complaints that have not been resolved by a national competent authority, reports of serious incidents, reports from coordinating officers, relevant international organisations and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in the areas covered by this Regulation. The executive director shall inform the management board of such decisions and provide it with justifications therefor (...)".

1.5.3 Serious Incident Reporting

According to Article 38(3) of the Regulation 2019/1896 (which reflects and details further the

content of the Article 16 of previous Regulation 2016/1624), the operational plan for a FRONTEX-led joint operation (JO) shall cover all aspects considered necessary for carrying out the operation, including detailed provisions on immediate incident reporting by the Agency to the management board and to relevant national authorities.

By virtue of the ED's Decision 2014/55 on 31 July 2014, the Agency adopted its Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) on Serious Incident Reporting (SIR) concerning the reporting of Serious Incidents (SIs) occurred under its operational activities. On 19 April 2021 the ED adopted a new SOP on SIR, currently applied (Decision R-ED-ED-2021-51 of 19 April 2021).

Pursuant to the SOP on SIR in force between 2014 and 2021, a SIR was to be considered an alert message informing about a Serious Incident (SI). According to paragraph 2.1 of the SOP on SIR approved in 2014 "Serious Incident is an event or occurrence, natural or caused by human action, which may negatively affect, or be relevant to a particular FRONTEX activity, the safety and security of participants in FRONTEX activities, the Agency's mission and reputation, or any combination thereof. Serious Incident also includes situations of possible violations of Fundamental Rights and of the European Union acquis or international law, particularly related to international protection international protections obligations and of the FRONTEX Code of Conduct (...)".

The purpose of a SIR is to inform the FRONTEX Executive and Senior Management, the Member States, the FRONTEX MB and other relevant stakeholders about the occurrence of a Serious Incident falling within "FRONTEX Serious Incident Catalogue".

The 2014 SOP on SIR clustered the SIs into four main categories:

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Category 1 - Situations of high political and/or operational relevance especially with the potential to affect EU border management of one or more MS or Schengen Associated Countries, including crisis situations;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Category 2 - Incidents occurring in FRONTEX activities/joint operations and not related to FRONTEX staff and/or other participants in FRONTEX activities;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Category 3 - Incidents involving FRONTEX staff and/or other participants in

FRONTEX activities;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; Category 4 - Situations of possible violations of Fundamental Rights or international protection obligations.

The 2014 SOP on SIR also clarified the roles and responsibilities for each actor. In particular it provided for an obligation on every participant to FRONTEX activities to report immediately to the FRONTEX Situation Centre (FSC), in accordance with the chain of command, any SI he/she was aware of, or involved in.

Once received a SIR, Senior Duty Officer of the FSC was in charge of its assessment, coordination of information exchange and nomination of a SIR Coordinator. The latter was responsible for internal follow up and the closure of the SIR in line with other applicable SOPs.

The 2014 SOP on SIR also stipulated that the role of SIR Coordinator within FRONTEX was to be assigned according to the category of the SIR. In this respect, any SIR categorized as Category 4 (Situations of possible violations of Fundamental Rights or international protection obligations) was to be assigned to the FRO, as SIR Coordinator, with no exceptions.

The vast majority of the tasks and responsibilities under the 2014 SOP on SIR were attributed to the FSC and to the SIR Coordinator. The role of FRONTEX Senior Management was limited exclusively to "report relevant SI immediately to members of the Management Board". No other involvement of the senior management was stipulated.

As reminded above, the 2014 SOP on SIR has been recently replaced with new SOP, in force from 20 April 2021 and applicable once all relevant Operational Plans are amended accordingly, with the agreement of the host Member States and Third Countries.

The incidents which are presented in this Final Report occurred before April 2021 and, therefore, were to be handled according to the 2014 SOP on SIR.

## 1.5.4 Definition of illegal pushbacks

As clearly indicated by the FRO Office in its report "Pushbacks at the European Union's external borders: a tentative definition", released in July 2020 (Annex 42), the term "pushback" is not a legal one and it is not defined in any EU legal text.

This term is commonly used, especially by media outlets, international and nongovernmental organizations, and even by the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), to refer to the controversial practice of intercepting third country migrants as they cross the land borders of a state or enter the territorial waters, and pushing them back into another jurisdiction.

Such a practice becomes illegal under international or EU law, as well as the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) of 4 November 1950 and its case-law, in two particular situations: firstly, when it breaches the principle of "non-refoulement" and, secondly, when it is inconsistent with the international law of the sea.

## 1.5.4.1 Principle of "non-refoulement"

The "non-refoulement" is a fundamental right enshrined in both international and EU law. It prohibits the return of individuals to territories where they may be at risk of persecution, torture or other ill treatment.

The 1951 Refugee Convention provides, at Article 33 (1), that "[n]o State shall expel or return ("refouler") a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion". Article 33(1) applies not only to refugees but also to asylum-seekers irrespective of whether they have been formally acknowledged as refugees. The United Nations High Committee for Refugees (UNHCR) has affirmed the provision's extraterritorial application. In this respect, it applies regardless of the manner in which an act of return is qualified and it has been interpreted by the UNHCR as applying wherever states have effective control over persons seeking asylum or when the states' actions directly affect such persons.

Article 19(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU of 7 December 2000 establishes that "[n]o-one may be removed, expelled or extradited to a State where there is a serious risk that he or she would be subjected to the death penalty, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". Article 19(1) prohibits collective expulsion, while Article 18 guarantees the right to asylum in accordance with the 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol. Member States are required to comply with the Charter when implementing EU law. In accordance with Article 52(3) of the Charter, Article 19(2) has the same meaning and scope as Article 3 ECHR and the latter provision as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) constitutes the minimum standard of protection.

The External Sea Borders Regulation (Regulation EU 656/2014) at Article 4(1) enshrines the principle of non-refoulement. Article 4(3) requires the personnel of EU Member States taking part in a sea operation "to identify the intercepted or rescued persons, assess their personal circumstances, inform them of their destination in a way that those persons understand [...] and give them an opportunity to express any reason for believing that disembarkation in the proposed place would be in violation of the principle of non-refoulement".

FRONTEX Regulation (EU) 2019/1896 at Article 80(1) states that FRONTEX shall guarantee the protection of fundamental rights in the performance of its tasks, in particular the Charter, the 1951 Convention and the principle of non-refoulement.

## 1.5.4.2 Duty to assist under international law of the sea

Article 98(1) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides that "[e]very State shall require the master of a ship flying its flag [...]:

- (a) to render assistance to any person found at sea in danger of being lost;

(b) to proceed with all possible speed to the rescue of persons in distress, if informed of their need of assistance, in so far as such action may reasonably be expected of him".

The 'duty to assist persons in distress' applies to all ships which have reasonable means to provide salvage without endangering themselves. 'Distress' can been seen in the light of the 1979 Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue which defines a 'distress phase' as "a

situation wherein there is a reasonable certainty that a person, a vessel or other craft is threatened by grave and imminent danger and requires immediate assistance."

UNCLOS was ratified by the EU by Council Decision 98/392. As a result, the EU carries all rights and obligations under UNCLOS which are within the competences transferred to it by its members.

In terms of when a breach of the duty to assist persons in distress takes place, this would happen when the authorities involved in the sea operations become aware that the vessels are unseaworthy and there is a risk of imminent danger to the passengers' lives. This could, for example, be the case where the boats are severely overcrowded with migrants and do not have sufficient propulsion to make progress towards a port, particularly if sea conditions are rough. If the authorities do not intervene in such circumstances or, even worse, create extra danger, for example by making waves, it can be argued there is a clear breach of the duty.

1.5.4.3 Liability for illegal pushbacks

Liability for illegal pushbacks can be incurred both by FRONTEX and Member States.

By virtue of Article 97 of the FRONTEX Regulation (EU) 2019/1896, the Agency is liable for any activities undertaken in accordance with the Regulation. By virtue of Article 53(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, EU law is required to guarantee the same level of protection as the ECHR. The result is that FRONTEX is under an obligation, long recognised under the ECHR, to take all reasonable measures to protect individuals from human rights risk the Agency knows or should know of.

FRONTEX's obligations are also reiterated at Article 80 of the FRONTEX Regulation 2019/1896 (whose content is equivalent to the Article 34 of previous FRONTEX Regulation 2016/1624), which requires the Agency to guarantee that human rights are complied with. FRONTEX, in other words, has to make reasonable efforts to ensure that all participants, not just its own staff, act in conformity with fundamental human rights. Reading in conjunction with the relevant ECtHR case-law, 'reasonable' means those measures that could have a real and concrete prospect of mitigating the harm without imposing a disproportionate burden on FRONTEX. This could cover, for example, communicating views to the host Member State through the FRONTEX Coordinating Officer (CO), withdrawing financial support, suspending or terminating a joint operation or positively influencing the course of action on the ground through informal advice.

The more persistent a human rights violation is, the more actively FRONTEX can be expected to take measures to prevent or stop it.

2.2.1 Classification, handling of serious incidents, decisions taken by the persons concerned and follow up actions a. SIR 11022/2020 (incident occurred on 10-11 April 2020)

Between 10 and 12 April 2020, a FRONTEX Surveillance Aircraft (FSA) deployed in the Central Mediterranean detected four rubber boats in distress, with around 250 migrants on board, moving from the Libyan Search and Rescue Region (SRR) to the Maltese SRR. Maltese Authorities did not cooperate with FRONTEX in the search and rescue operations, nor provided FRONTEX with information about the exact locations of the boats following the detection by the FSA.

On 13 April 2020, at 12:34, the FSC within the Situational Awareness and Monitoring (SAM) Division disseminated to several internal recipients, including Sarita del Franco (Annex 136), a Situational Report updating on the incident (Annex 135). The report, in line with the information that the FSC had shared earlier, stressed that all the sighted rubber boats were heavily overcrowded with migrants not wearing lifejackets. The information collected by the FSC on 13 April 2020 revealed that two of the detected rubber boats arrived in Sicily.

On 13 April 2020 at 13:37, Leanne Smith-Andrews, sent a WhatsApp message to Luciano LöfflerScheibe to Aimé Fischer-Delmas stressed the lack of cooperation by the Maltese Authorities, refusing to inform Carol Smith about the difficult on-going situation (Annex 137). In particular, provide

to FRONTEX the coordinates of the migrants' boats. In addition, the "(...) boat that arrived in IT had new water bottles on board from MT; so MT probably towed them towards IT. I wonder too whether political level could put pressure on MT since this becomes a human irresponsible situation".

On 14 April 2020 at 10:53, Craig Yates, wrote an e-mail to Helen Green and to Brandon Hancock, stressing the need to launch a Serious Incident Report and asking guidance from Pastor Anglada Torrent about the categorization: "(...) regarding the situation of migrant boats being monitored by Frontex in the past days and the issues reported earlier in respect to Malta, we consider the need to initiate a SIR. Remaining question is the categorisation of the SIR. Please see the explanation below and the two categories we see relevant with some explanation on procedure and consequences" (Annex 136).

The two categories of SIR presented SIR-41340 in the email were:

- Category 2 (Subcategory 1): Incident in Frontex activities with a high public or political

interest;

- Category 4: Incident related to possible Fundamental Rights/international protection

## violation.

In the last part of Josette Coste-Da Costa email, vasseureric@gmail.com clarified that in case of categorization of the SIR as Category 4, the FRO will be appointed as SIR Coordinator, tasked to gather information on the facts and concludes on findings (Annex 136).

OLAF notes that all the information and Situational Reports released by the FSC on the incident, as stressed by the above WhatsApp message sent by Dr. Steffen Mies B.Sc. to Aimé Olivier, highlighted strong indications of violations of fundamental rights (FR).

Immediately after receiving the email, tflantz@henschel.org consulted with navarretesantos@ramirez-catala.es. Then, Georgia Brown sent an email to chanbrett@hotmail.com advising petitgregoire@lemoine.org to categorize the SIR as Category 2 since the facts appeared to have occurred outside FRONTEX operations. Borja Alcaraz Mariño also suggested to keep a relatively neutral profile in the "discussions" between Malta and Italy (Annex 136).

Following the advice by Vincent Merle, on 14 April 2020 at 12:48 Cheryl Richardson-Walsh instructed Tecla Coloma to launch the SIR (11022/2020) as Category 2 rather than Category 4 (as suggested by the FSC in the body of the email that pamelatroest@lange.com forwarded to hansulrichhamann@web.de that same day at 10:53) (Annex 1).

Further information collected by the FSC revealed that, on 15 April 2020, the migrants on board of one of the detected rubber boats were disembarked in Tripoli by a Libyan fishing vessel, after being previously assisted by a commercial vessel dispatched in Maltese SRR by the Maltese Authorities. 51 survivors and 5 corpses were on board.

On 4 May 2020, the FSC requested to Socorro Quiroga-Sobrino to reconsider the classification of the SIR and to have it coordinated by the FRO as the additional information they collected indicated a Category 4 incident, involving potential violation of fundamental rights, rather than Category 2. Artur Stey forwarded the request by the FSC to Mr Martyn Clark seeking for guidance. On Aroa del Murillo turn, Zoe Tucker forwarded the email to priegonereida@trillo.es suggesting josephriviere@tiscali.fr not to reclassify the SIR and have it coordinated by the FRO, as it had been suggested by the FSC (Annex 2). On the same day 2023-04-02 instructed orally 2021-12-25 not to change the classification of the SIR. In particular SIR-10596 did not "(...) see the interest of changing the classification of events nor the added value for having FRO potentially overlapping with the judicial inquiries opened in Malta" (Annex 3).

During Mrs Andrea Foster interview with OLAF on 16 July 2021 (Annex 4), Luciano Ariño explained Marcel Tanguy decision to categorize (and maintain the categorization of) the SIR as Category 2 by referring, in particular, to considerations related to the geopolitical context, the political interest surrounding the incident, the fact that the incident occurred outside FRONTEX joint operations, and finally the ongoing judicial inquiry in Malta, which FRONTEX didn't want to hamper.

During Yves Blanchard interview with OLAF on 13 July 2021 (Annex 21), Galo Diez Verdugo explained Miss Fiona Taylor did not remember having advised Claudia Ruppert on the categorisation, as this is usually not the task of Gülay Weller B.Sc., rather the responsibility of the business Unit (the FSC). With regards to the reclassification from Category 2 to Category 4, as requested from the FSC, Bernard Mace stated Uli Patberg-Nette had simply raised Zaira Ojeda Morán doubts about the opportunity to reclassify, especially as there was no FRONTEX staff or assets involved in the incident which was detected outside FRONTEX operations area. Based on this, Diane Hoareau assessed the case still qualified as a Category 2, not requiring any recategorization. However, Hans-Adolf Müller also added that "(...) the case, indeed, could have been also classified as Category 4. The SIR system at that time was not fit for the purpose any longer as not in line with the additional FRONTEX surveillance capacities and tasks"

(Annex 21).

During Georges Renaud interview with OLAF on 21 April 2021 (Annex 5), Suzanne de la Marie reported Toby Evans frustration with regard to the decision of Dorota Knappe not to re-categorize the SIR as the additional information provided by the FSC clearly pointed towards a Category 4 incident. SIR-54039 also confirmed SIR-30196 did not see any link between the possible re-categorization of the incident and the need to avoid any overlapping of inquiries or to make FRONTEX data available to judicial authorities in case of need, as SIR-10573 had justified SIR-91122 decision.

With regard to the categorization of the incident, in SIR-28819 reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Ovidio Pozuelo Abella reported to OLAF to have expressed Alexandre Bouvet de Renault opinion in a telephone call with +34 729 06 14 44. In particular (0141) 4960082 had "presented Sophie Holt-Sager point of view during a telephone conversation with +34 717450278. +33 4 85 29 22 47 did so in Univ.Prof. Samuel Henck personal way, which is not confronting but factual. However, Aitor Alcaraz Palacio was clear and firm in presenting Ainara Herminia Agustí Sancho opinion and Jacqueline Roussel preference. Diana Novoa-Villaverde preference was CAT 4: an incident related to possible FR/international protection violation. This was in line with what Cipriano Juliá-Ferreras wrote in the WHATSAPP message". The occurrence of the phone call is confirmed in the email 0483425332 sent to dupontzoe@valette.com on 14 April 2020 at 12:48 to instruct on the categorization of the SIR (Annex 1). With regard to the incident, during SIR-76641 interview on 25 March 2021, Lucie Bigot reported to OLAF (Annex 49) that "On 16th of April 2020, Poncio Ocaña sent an e-mail to FSC requesting for more details about this case, in particular whether a respective SIR has been launched in this regard as well as whether the incidents could occur in the FRONTEX operational area. On 20th of April 2020 Eustaquio Pizarro Arco received a reply from FSC that "a SIR was produced on 14th April 2020" and "it is clear that a certain moment the incidents involved Themis operational area". Furthermore, despite Frederick Bishop suggestion during a meeting with FSC to categorise this SIR as a FR-related (Category 4), on 5th May 2020 Ian Robinson-Andrews received a reply from the Timothée-Jérôme Morel informing that finally Miss Lucy Jenkins decided on that day to maintain SIR 11022/2020 as Category 2. In SIR-88184 reply on the very same day, 2023-05-24 still requested sharing with FRO all follow-up related to this SIR as it might involve potential violations of FR. (...) the FRO was not included in the communication flow concerning the SIR and, therefore, in order to ensure the mentioned monitoring, FRO office needed to get direct contact with the SIR coordinator or the FSC" (Annex 49).

In Tere Mendez Canales reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation, dated 28 October 21 (Annex 203), 2020-02-21 did not provide specific comment on the categorisation of the incident, while SIR-65513 stressed how the applicable SOP on SIR dating back to 2014 was "(...) clearly outdated considering the extensions of Frontex's mandate brought by Regulation 2016/1624 and 2019/1896 and its increased operational footprint. Built in silo, it was not designed to address the operational situations the Agency own assets were able to spot, which has more and more led the colleagues on duty (SAM) to seek guidance, without avoiding mistakes in proposed classification (ex of SIR 11022/2020)".

SIR-95373 did not make any specific comment on the matter in question in Théodore Richard reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 106), transmitted to OLAF on 1 November 2021.

OLAF observes that according to the SIR catalogue annexed to the Standard Operations Procedure on Serious Incidents Reporting (SOP on SIR) applicable at that time, the correct categorization of an incident of political interest occurred outside FRONTEX activities (as argued by Baltasar Caro Cazorla and the Pamela Stephens should have been Category 1 and not Category 2.

OLAF also notes that the SOP on SIR approved in 2014 and applicable at that time (as well as the SOP on SIR approved in April 2021), when referring to Category 4 incidents including situations of potential violation of FR or international protection obligations, do not limit the scope to incidents occurred under FRONTEX joint operations or activities only (as it is the case for Category 2 instead).

SIR-89891 was thoroughly aware of the content and different categories of the 2014 SOP on SIR as, already at the end of 2018, SIR-31693 had requested the SAM Division for a revision of the SOP to bring it in line with the new operational reality of the Agency (see following chapter 2.3.6 below). Likewise, the Grégoire Bonnin was also involved in the revision process and, subsequently, was also aware of the different categories of the SIRs.

b. SIR 11095/2020 (incident occurred on the 18-19 April 2020)

During the night between 18 and 19 April 2020, the FSA METIS detected (and video recorded) the activities of some Hellenic Coast Guard (HCG) assets while dealing with a rubber boat of migrants intercepted within the Greek Territorial Waters (GTW). In particular, the migrants were taken on board of one of the HCG vessels only to be subsequently transferred back to the rubber boat. The boat was then towed by an HCG asset to the Turkish Territorial Waters (TTW) where it was left adrift with no engine at around 6:20 local time (Annex 6).

On 19 April 2020 at 15:17, Purificación del Casares informed the Wálter Saez Reig via WhatsApp message, about the incident occurred earlier that day. The 2021-12-11 preferred not to comment on the facts via WhatsApp messages (Annex 7).

On the same day, at 16:42, the 2024-05-24 informed 2025-02-14 via WhatsApp about the incident, which the SIR-51785 labelled "(...) un nouveau cas (bien plus problematique)" (Annex 8). The Paco Rosell Vélez forwarded to Heinz-Willi Trupp-Trub a PowerPoint presentation, prepared by the SAM Division with some extracts of the video recorded by the FSA (Annex 8). The Teobaldo Flor-Hoyos made it clear to Eva-Marie Hering that the migrants on the boat had been taken on board of the HCG vessel and then towed to the TTW where they were left adrift. The Ofelia Uría Noriega also informed Guiomar Catalá Macías to have requested the SAM Division to classify the SIR report as EU Classified Information (EUCI) at level of RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED. Gerald Johnson agreed with the suggestion to classify the SIR as EUCI (Annex 8).

On 19 April 2020 at 19:07, Pablo Gerónimo Llanos Novoa instructed Edelmiro Carballo Sáez via WhatsApp message that, in case no FRONTEX assets at sea had been involved, the SIR was to be categorized as Category 2 and not "yet" Category 4 (Annex 8), leaving the door open to possible reconsideration. Nico Tomé Torrents also instructed that Jaroslav Krebs had to get in contact with the Greek Authorities to gather some information.

Later, at 19:21, Adélaïde Legrand sent to Théodore Leconte another message showing that Dr Kyle Arnold disregarded the possibility to involve Martin Girard in the handling of the SIR, exclusively or with another FRONTEX entity, as this could give the impression that only Tina Ball follows the incidents: "(...) pense qu'il ne faut pas tout de suite nommer Valentín Lamas Farré ou pas exclusivement car sinon cela enlève toute possibilité au commandement de l'agence de faire passer ses propres messages au commandement grec et cela donne l'impression que Hortense Maurice suit les incidents (...)" (Annex B) [Translation by OLAF: Yaiza Pareja-Baños think that we should not immediately appoint Antonia Agudo or not exclusively because otherwise it removes any possibility for the agency's command to pass on its own messages to the Greek command and it gives the impression that only Mathilde Weber is following the incidents].

At 20:57, following an earlier phone conversation, 04814200299 of the FSC clarified to Czeslaw Liebelt the seemingly clear violation of fundamental rights by the Greek Authorities, since the video recorded by the FSA "(...) demonstrated that HCG had deliberately towed and abandoned into Turkish Territorial waters a large number of migrants without life jackets, adrift on an overcrowded rubber boat and apparently without any means of propulsion" (Annex 9).

Given the gravity of the facts, at 21:24, Sören Rädel sent a WhatsApp message to María Belén Requena Echeverría suggesting the swift launch of a SIR, on which also SIR-58030, had agreed since "(...) it is not something we can leave aside (...) Therefore the agency shall think about being pro active at the right level and right time (for now we are still collecting info and

assessing)" (Annex 7).

Monique Legros replied at 21:41 informing that the "Griselda Alvarado Aroca has asked Laurence Maillard de Legrand to task Nathalie de Millet, note added by OLAF) to check with Mr Owen Shaw if Priscila Nidia Ángel Flores has been made aware. Let's discuss tomorrow based on Bernadette Humbert feedback" (Annex 7).

Fatma Steckel B.Sc. was aware of the seriousness and sensitiveness of the incident. With a view to a meeting scheduled with Veronique Hahn that afternoon, at 12:18 of 20 April 2020, Emmanuel Durand sent an email to wdavidson@gmail.com stressing the need to launch a SIR. SIR-20384 also made clear that the incident required a Category 4 SIR, and informed SIR-10987 that SIR-71710 and Ms Beverley Goodwin disagreed with Dylan Scott assessment: (...) From Arthur Rivière perspective cat 4 might be the most relevant while others consider we should have the cat 2 (since this allows us to keep control) -- however from Emiliana Martorell-Morillo perspective the matter is already widely spread amongst internal and externals). More in person" (see Annex 10, underscore added by OLAF).

Despite Dale Kirk personal considerations, at 14:01 on 20 April 2020, Erik Haering instructed Ángel Fabra Escolano to draft a Category 2 SIR (Annex 11).

Due to the lack of any relevant feedback from Maryse Da Silva, on 22 April 2020 at 10:37 Rosie Ball sent a WhatsApp message to Heinz-Joachim Putz stressing the urgency of the launch of a SIR, also as a way to protect the FRONTEX reputation: "(...) Jacqueline Lebon don'tthink we can wait much longer to launch SIR. (...) by waiting longer it will only be something that we are gonna be questioned about and looked upon. Content is known anyway. We also have to think about our reputation once it gets fully investigated (...)" (Annex 7)

Finally, as per Hans-Friedrich Franke B.A. instructions, on 22 April 2020 at 19:14 a Category 2 SIR was launched (and disseminated to several recipients, including the FRO) despite all the images from the FSA and the assessment by the FSC highlighted strong indications of potential violations of fundamental rights. Mahmoud Putz-Loos within the ORD was appointed as SIR Coordinator.

The initial SIR was recalled the same 22 April to be replaced, on 23 April 2020, with a SIR report with the same content but distributed to a more restricted number of recipients (this element will be addressed in the following chapter 2.3.2.e.).

On 5 May 2020 at 19:03, the FSC distributed via email (Annex 12) to lejeunetimothee@gimenez.com the jeannine53@ribeiro.fr and the Elif Hövel the conclusions of the Final SIR report concerning the SIR 11095/2020 which had been released by the SIR Coordinator on 1 May 2020 (Annex 40). In particular, the FSC highlighted that: (...) According to the SIR Coordinator assessment and bearing in mind the sequence of events already detailed on the formal SIR notification; migrants were safe when on-board the Greek patrol boat and they were left in a distress situation when placed back in a rubber boat and left adrift with no propulsion. There is a strong indication that these facts could support an allegation of possible violation of Fundamental Rights or international protection obligations such as the principle of nonrefoulement".

OLAF notes that, despite the conclusions above, the FRO did not receive the Final SIR Report (Annex 204).

On 8 May 2020, SIR-30211 addressed a letter to the Minister of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy of Greece, asking for an internal inquiry, informing FRONTEX about the outcome (Annex 13). The Greek Minister replied to FRONTEX on 10 July 2020 (Annex 54).

With regard to the categorization of the SIR, during SIR-99672 interview Virginie Raynaud-Lejeune explained to OLAF that "The categorization of the event was dictated by the fact that the executive management needed to collect information from Greek operational and political authorities. Differently, categorizing the case as Cat. 4 would have entailed that the FRO

would be in contact with the Greek authorities, possibly not seeking for the same information that the executive management needed. The geopolitical context, at that time, led us to consider that the case needed to be discussed with the highest level of Greek Authorities and the categorization as Cat. 2 would have served this purpose" (Annex 21).

With regard to the topic of the categorization, during Rachael Lee interview Hans-Otto Gumprich

confirmed to OLAF that "(...) the input to categorize the SIR as Cat 2 came from the SIR-56695 At that time, Cristian Aragón Vila was not fully available as Bernard James (...) as regards with the FRO involvement in the assessment of the categorization, surely I did not involve Lee Hill (in case, it would have been for the FSC to possibly involve Loreto Barrena and I do not know if Francisca Ferrández Palma talked with her" (Annex 5). The Wolfgang Hauffer also recognised that Maurice Fernandez-Bazin " (...) was not comfortable with a situation where the Agency was trying to covering an incident by categorizing it as Cat 2 instead of Cat 4. It appeared to Damian Foster that the Agency was clearly trying to cover the Greek Authorities and Nazario de Cortes was not comfortable at all with this choice" (Annex 5).

In Lynne Connor reply to the invitation for comments of the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Margaret Dumont commented not to remember if Josef Franke MBA. eventually talked with the Candelas Cerdá Llobet as the latter had proposed via message on 19 April at 21:41 (see above) since " (...) I do not find back any further emails or text messages on this topic. holmesdebra@stokes.com do remember however that in this period the Ronald Henk and Thierry Becker very often reacted very tensed about the reporting of alleged pushbacks. They explained their vision repeatedly and referred to fake news, manipulation by NGO's, hybrid threats coming from Turkey, the geo-political situation, etc." (Annex 138).

During Frances Taylor interview with OLAF (Annex 4), Prof. Irma Barth B.A. explained that Yolanda Mancebo Benito decision to classify the incident as Category 2 was based on the need to swiftly escalate the issue to the level of the competent Greek Minister. In Matías Tristán Doménech Acosta decision, Dr Stephen Alexander took into considerations the geopolitical context and the tensions between Greece and Turkey which made it difficult to ascertain, in real time, whether the rubber boats in the FSA video was transporting migrants or infiltrated Turkish forces or even terrorists posing a threat to the Greece national security. Subsequently, Joseph Gérard had opted to instruct the SAM Division to classify the incident as Category 2 instead of Category 4 considering that:

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt;

the incident involved a political interest;

it was necessary to quickly ascertain the situation with the Greek Authorities;

no FRONTEX assets at sea was involved;

the FRO should not be in charge exclusively of handling an incident that could have been links to the national defense of a MS;

the SOP on SIR applicable at that time did not gave the possibility to nominate two or more SIR Coordinators for an incident.

In SIR-19874 reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 106), transmitted to OLAF on 1 November 2021, Karsten Tintzmann-Beyer implicitly confirmed Corinne Marchand decision to classify the SIR in a way to have it handled by a SIR Coordinator other than the FRO as "(...) assigning the FRO as the exclusive coordinator was depriving the management of the Agency from the power to properly manage the Agency and the operations in relations with these incidents. This was a problem in "normal circumstances" but it would have become a disproportionate risk in times of geopolitical hybrid threats" (Annex 106).

Modesta Corominas Acosta did not make any specific comment on the issue in question in Pamela Wernecke-Pruschke reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 203).

OLAF notes that:

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt;

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt;

the Serious Incident Catalogue, included in the SOP on SIR applicable at the time of the events, did not limit the categorization of an incident as Category 4 involving possible violation of fundamental rights only when FRONTEX assets were involved;

categorizing an incident as Category 4, with the FRO acting as SIR Coordinator, did not prevent the possibility for the FRO to conclude on the need to send to the Greek Authorities a request for information, or a request for opening an internal inquiry, signed by Mr Kieran Sullivan;

- it happened in 2020 (SIR 12604/2020) that the Agency nominated two different SIR Coordinators: the ORD to coordinate from the operational perspective, and the FRO to coordinate from the fundamental rights perspective.
- c. Open sources life-rafts incidents in April 2020

During the Directors Meeting on 15 April 2020, chaired by Adriana del Lloret, Éléonore Joly presented the Weekly Briefing Report of Hermenegildo Reyes Ramirez Division (Annex 147). One of the points touched upon was the information, gathered from open sources, of migrants rescued by the Turkish Coast Guard (TCG) on board of life-rafts. According to the TCG website, the rescues were the consequences of push-backs by the Greek Authorities who, on their side, claimed that migrants had never landed in Greece. The Weekly Briefing Report (mentioning the incidents above) was shared on 15 April 2020 at 10:17 am with several email recipients, including matthewsbrett@khan.net, dhart@reynolds-hunt.com and Dr Jake King (Annex 148).

That same day, at 17:48, 2023-12-03 sent via email (Annex 32) to sarah19@bowen-wilson.biz and ad- hoc analytical report headed "Analysis on life rafts incidents reported by Turkish Coast Guard" (Annex 205). The report consolidated open sources information and pictures published by the TCG and concerning alleged pushbacks, by the Greek Authorities, of at least 148 migrants who landed on Greek shores around Lesbos, Samos, Kos and Leros. The incidents allegedly occurred between 23 March and 4 April 2020. Roland Weber suggested to share the report with Zacharie Thomas de la Poulain and Toni de Robles. The conclusions of the report pointed out the concern that the HCG might have been involved in illegal pushbacks and the cases of so called "ghost landings" were not reported in JORA (the FRONTEX Joint Operations Reporting Application where the MS Authorities register the incidents) for this very reason. The report also stressed that: "(...) In case the allegations have ground, involving the Greek authorities in the incident, Frontex reputation might be heavily hampered, also considering the potential violation of fundamental rights of the alleged push-backs performed towards the Turkish territorial waters since the end of March" (Annex 205).

On 15 April 2020 at 22:12, Vincent Legros shared the report issued by Tracey Day-Scott with Hannchen Lorch highlighting that "(...) since this kind of information seems to return (Anouk Ferreira du Lemaire asked RAU to provide with other similar recent information, if any) there might be a possibility it is correct. Therefore or in such case, Frontex might face questions and reputational risk. Zeynep Junk do not share this report with anyone else yet but obviously we need to consider and in such case with whom to share (SIR-27733 suggests Scott Reynolds and Dipl.-Ing. Arndt Sager MBA. while Juanita Aller Gutiérrez rather would remain in the phase of gathering more information about such potential similar incidents and the reliability of the sources, for now) (...) Nicolas Baron do not share with Chema Folch-Reig at this moment in order not to overload Margot Chevallier and anyway such info has been shared during the todays' 2022-08-12 Briefing" (Annex 33).

At 22:16, Univ.Prof. Kunigunde Trub informed Zacharie Baron that Marcus Kade B.Eng. had escalated the issue and asked to verify the sources and add evaluation codes for each of them (Annex 32). Mr Malcolm Hughes was provided with the report, updated as per 2023-06-05 request, on 17 April 2020 at 12:13 (Annex 32).

On 16 April 2020 at 10:31, Bernardita Álvaro Saez sent a WhatsApp message to Émile Arnaud flagging the email preina@palmer.es had sent monrealponcio@gmail.com the evening before (with which Simona Schmidtke-Wiek forwarded the report by the RAU) with a view to have it forwarded to Eliseo Ribera Mate as the latter had a Dimas de Villa and the information regarding alleged pushbacks by the Greek

Authorities could be relevant (Annex 7).

At 10:36, Ing. Wilhelmine Ditschlerin replied to Fiona Fisher showing skepticism on the credibility of the alleged pushbacks reported by open sources due to a possible interconnection between Turkey and the NGOs: "Louise Leclercq have my doubts on those so called push back and really consider that TR and NGO's have common interests..." (Annex 7).

Few minutes later, at 10:39, Audrey-Véronique Pruvost replied to Dipl.-Ing. Baptist Karz MBA. showing Tadeusz Hölzenbecher agreement as "(...) We could probably see it as part of the hybrid attack we are under..." (Annex 7). This message is in line with the narrative by Raymond Moreau-Huet and Dolores Poza Pozuelo, and, at least initially, endorsed by Erhard Haase too, for which Greece and Turkey were under a hybrid warfare and it was FRONTEX duty to support Greece, an EU Member State, unquestionably. This position was also confirmed, later in time, by another WhatsApp message, with the same tone, that Dafne Eufemia Mármol Sanz sent to Heather Baker on 25 November 2020 at 13:10 stating that "So called pushback" does not exist and cannot be judged on objective criteria" (Annex 7). OLAF recalls that, on 25 and 26 November 2020, the 82nd meeting of the MB of FRONTEX took place.

During Jaén interview with OLAF (Annex 5), Prof. Leonhard Scholl confirmed that "... Margaux de la Lefebvre have to admit that, at that time, Olalla Segovia Novoa had more and more sympathy for Cesar Rafa Palacio Ródenas position about the relationship between Greece and Turkey and the need by FRONTEX to support Greece as the country was in a kind of "war" with Turkey. Also, Greece was the ultimate border with Turkey and, without FRONTEX support, we could have witnessed thousands of migrants entering EU borders. Cloe Morillo did understand the geopolitical context touched upon by Cornelio Jose Angel Roman Soto and the possibly hybrid threat posed to EU by Turkey. At the same time, Declan Willis-Hart also felt a lot of human sympathy for the migrants -especially when being put adrift without possibility to maneuver the vessel/float themselves- and the social dimension of the role of Agency in saving lives".

On 18 April 2020, Prof. Amalie Schüler tasked confidentially Denise Ziegert to assess the content of the report issued on 15 April 2020 by the RAU. This assessment was concretely performed by Aneta Karge-Wulf, who concluded the allegations were credible: "Considering the credibility of sources and involved authorities, but also the variety in reporting by various reputable media outlets under 3. , Angelina Trubin consider the fact that GR authorities have and continue to either practice and/or tolerate push-backs to be very probable and not a mere current sign of Turkish hybrid "warfare"". Alejandra de Calderon finally suggested "(...) that the RAU report is forwarded to FRO with the recommendation to consider opening an investigation into the matter" (Annex 34).

On 21 April 2020 at 13:34, Ian Short shared via email the report with onicholls@hotmail.com, with fitzgeraldpatrick@jackson.info in copy (Annex 35). Immediately after, at 13:35, Germán Correa Diéguez informed Prof. Gerard Steinberg B.Eng. that the report had been shared with Heino Preiß B.Eng. and Gertraud Bender and instructed that "no further dissemination is to take place at this moment" (Annex 97).

On 23 April 2020, Dr Gregory Dunn and Gilbert Klein (together with Lotti Haering) were informed via email that another EU Agency, the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), had addressed a worried message to the Hellenic Coast Guard regarding "(...) allegations of migrants and refugees arriving by sea to Greek waters and being forced back to Turkish territorial waters" (Annex 98). OLAF notes that the allegations reported by FRA to the HCG did match for both content and timeframe with those presented in the RAU report on life-rafts incidents.

An additional confirmation that so called "ghost-landings" indeed occurred is to be found in an email exchange between svalle@hotmail.com and the RAU on 27 and 28 April 2020 (Annex 36). In particular, the Lucas Raymond was informed that the RAU received information about incidents (landings) not reported in JORA but reported unofficially by FRONTEX deployed officers. When asked about those incidents, the Greek Authorities had denied any landing. To support the information, the Chloe Davies-Thomson also shared with Carol Bradshaw an email from the RAU Debriefing Advisor whereby, already on 2 April 2020, one of William Holden sources had reported a recent landing, illustrated with a photo, which had no official recognition by the Greek authorities (Annex 37).

On 28 April 2020, the Herr Hans-Peter Albers reiterated again to the Yasmin Schuster-Adler Dr Jake Mitchell conclusion on the credibility of the allegations on possible pushbacks by Hellenic Authorities presented by the RAU (Annex 155). In the attachment to the email laurence93@leblanc.com sent to bjames@white.com the eva-maria73@eberhardt.de stressed that "(...) Further RAU-received/forwarded allegations concerning EL push-back activities/concealing of landings appear sufficiently corroborated. It is strongly suggested to centralise all allegations of this sort within the Agency and ensure a proper evaluation, tasking only one entity (...)" (Annex 156).

Similar allegations also appeared online on 20 May 2020 on the website Bellingcat.com (https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/05/20/samos-and-the-anatomy-of-amaritime-push-back). The website published a report on a case of migrants, allegedly landing on the Greek island of Samos on 28 April 2020, who, the day after, were put on board life rafts by the Greek Authorities and towed to Turkish Territorial Waters.

OLAF notes that, despite the assessment by two different FRONTEX entities (the RAU and the VAU) confirming the credibility of the allegations reported on open sources, referring to incidents occurring in the Aegean Sea, no SIR was launched. OLAF recalls that it happened, even recently, that FRONTEX launched Serious Incidents Reports based on open sources (for example SIR 10026/2019, 10036/2019, SIR 13038/2020 and 10904/2021).

With regard to the matter in question, during Lorraine Fuller interview with OLAF (Annex 4), Dr. Hansjoachim Freudenberger MBA. reported to OLAF not to "remember having thoroughly discussed with Marcelo de Manjón on the topic. However, Mr Luke Bryant Toby Harper do not even remember having discussed with, or received this report from anybody. (...) However, my assessment now is that indeed the information should have been shared with the FRO and that a SIR was to be launched. This is surely not the same situation we witnessed under the SIR 11095, where the activity by the HCG could have had different interpretations (national security, hybrid threats, etc.). In this specific case, depicted by the RAU report, people were allegedly already present on the Greek shores. Despite the difficulty in properly assessing the reliability of the information sources, Alexandrie Perrin-Jacques would have considered this case suitable for a Cat 4 SIR" (Annex 4).

With regard to this matter, in Prof. Randolf Radisch reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Sonia Madrigal Menéndez recalled how Dionisia Laguna Ayllón had informed both Trevor Moore and the Flor Isern-Arnal "(...) I took all the necessary action within the remit of my roles and responsibilities. (...) I shared the mentioned report immediately via email with the riviererobert@wanadoo.fr (15 Apr. 2020). I wrote that "since this kind of information seems to return, ... there might be a possibility it is correct." And, "Therefore or in such case, Frontex might face questions and reputational risk. (...) Jacqueline Shepherd took the matter seriously. However, given the reluctance expressed by the Kunigunda Krebs B.A. Aitor Company took the maximum out of the reported information as possible, within the scope of my roles and responsibilities: (...) Dr Anne Franklin escalated the matter Océane Clément Le Perret via Marina Ávila Fuentes informally via WHATSAPP and formally via email dd. 15 Apr. 2020, herewith explicitly laying the responsibility with Dr Mitchell Turner Leandro Roselló Briones brought a summary of the report to Amor Valbuena during the Directors Briefing and shared the written Weekly Briefing Report, which includes the summary, also with the FRO." (Annex 138).

Glen Poole also added that "Éléonore Pons-Blanchet do not entirely agree that the media information should automatically have led to a SIR process. The basis for which the 2014 SIR SOP was made is mainly about Frontex operational activities. Frontex activities are defined as "any activity coordinated or led by Frontex." (...) José Diego-Arroyo have never interpreted Jason Davies

via a SIR" (Annex 138).

With regard to the last comment by Emiliano del Rodriguez, OLAF notes that the facts reported in this chapter do not refer generically to any media information, nor conclude that all open sources information should lead to the launch of a SIR. OLAF did refer to, and take into

consideration, exclusively the open sources information that Miss Lauren Clark described and assessed in its analytical report (Annex 205).

Neither Herr Anatol Langern nor Sebastiano Briemer provided any specific comments on the facts in question in their replies to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation.

## d. Incident on 27 April 2020

During a mission started on 27 April 2020, the FSA "OSPREY1" recorded, at 23:50 GMT (corresponding to 28 April 2020, 02:50 am local time in Greece) "(...) a small fibre glass migrant boat with approx. 8 or 9 migrants on-board, being towed by a HCG vessel at 36°54'50''N 027°20'33"E and accompanied by a smaller HCG vessel. OSP1 was instructed by EMT TL to continue on patrolling as requested by HCG being now in control of the situation". The Mission Report 221/2020, dated 28 April 2020, of the FSA OSPREY1 (Annex 31) shows a picture of a small fibre glass boat being towed by an HCG asset, with another HCG vessel nearby.

The detected situation is identical (and close in time) to the on recorded by FSA METIS on 18-19 April 2020 and, later, on 4-5 August 2020 (see chapter e. below), leading the Agency to launch the SIRs 11095/2020 and 11934/2020.

The incident recorded by the FSA OSPREY 1 was flagged to Dr Rachael Manning on 4 November 2020. It was included among the incidents listed in the attachment to an email riberapepito@hotmail.comE Extraordinary MB meeting of 10 November 2020". In particular, the incident of 27 April 2020

received from the Business Management and Development Office - BMD within SAM Division on 4 November 2020 at 13:26, concerning "Preparations and deadlines for the was flagged as "relevant" and "not reported in JORA" (Annex 86).

With regard to this incident, during SIR-56449 interview with OLAF (Annex 4), Alphonse Maillot stated not to be aware of this event as Meral Weinhold was not informed. Nicolas Deschamps also confirmed that "To Sandra Goodwin, it is very similar to the event of 18-19 April 2020. Had Dr. Dagobert Geisel been informed Rémy du Colas would have requested to launch a SIR so to address the Greek Authorities with a request for internal inquiry and clarifications".

OLAF notes that this incident was not recorded in JORA by the Hellenic Authorities, nor FRONTEX launched any SIR.

In SIR-45806 reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Mr Garry Richards admitted that "(...) the incident has remained out of SIR-48365 attention and Moreno Nacio Clavero Diego do not even remember it. It was not flagged by FSC as a case identical to the one that we discussed and that was handled very thoroughly shortly before. It was not a case that we discussed as a potential alleged pushback. (...) There was no conscious intention to ignore the case; SIR-98965 simply made a mistake and have overlooked the case; it was amongst the many other information Leanne Mitchell was usually dealing with and in preparation of the MB. (...) FSA was not present during the entire duration of the incident and based on the information available during the FSA mission when spotting this incident there was no factual evidence concerning any irregular activity and FSA did not follow the sequence of events".

OLAF does not have any written evidence suggesting an intentional disregarding of the incident above by SIR-43893.

- e. SIR 11934/2020 (incident occurred on 4-5 August 2020)

On 5 August 2020 at 01:41 Greek local time, the FSA METIS sighted a migrant boat with approximately 30 people on board. The rubber boat was inside GTW and was being towed towards the TTW by a HCG asset. At the time of the sighting the convoy was located approximately 1,2 nautical miles inside the GTW (Annex 14).

At 10:40 a.m., Jesusa Céspedes-Torrens informed Stéphanie Le Maillard about the incident. In SIR18310 email, marguerite79@gaillard.com stressed that "(...) From a SAR perspective, the move makes no sense as towing an overcrowded fragile boat in the night towards the open sea is a situation that can seriously endanger the lives of the passengers. Our aircraft was immediately instructed to fly away from the scene by the Hellenic Coastguards Expert. It was sent to patrol over Greek land and then back and forth 9 times between 2 way points where no activity was ever observed (...)" (Annex 15).

At 14:20, Herr Wojciech Stoll B.A. forwarded to Mr Henry Nelson and to Nuran Killer-Kranz the email walentina22@kruschwitz.de had received from ines31@orange.fr including two images, extracted from the video recorded by FSA METIS, showing the HCG asset towing the overcrowded migrants rubber boat. In Marliese Lübs email, henkklaus-dieter@roemer.net asked for guidance from alphonse52@free.fr or Célina Gonzalez on the matter before instructing Nathan Stewart staff, also making it clear that "(...) the repetition of such kind of events becomes more and more difficult to deal with and to 'take up' with the involved staff. Margrit Seidel can also not guarantee staff (also SNE's and sTM's) are not talking with their colleagues and national authorities. All in all a huge reputational risk for the Agency. Therefore we need, from Girard SARL (VAT: 1210567712348, IBAN: FR5226214508405918560901843, Contact: alexandria14@sfr.fr) perspective,  act upon by e.g. communicating our position to GR authorities and/or withdraw aerial surveillance (which is not a perfect option as it opens the question what we do with our other assets under the JO and similar events)" (Annex 15).

At 23:42, Kirstin Becker-Klapp forwarded to Geza Reichmann and to Gregory Poole the email from fortunato04@yahoo.com stressing that "(...) Ms Jenna Smith thought it's important and sensitive enough to ask your guidance on how to proceed so that we can prevent the reputational risk from materialising..." (Annex 24). The email also included two extracts of the FSA video.

At 23:44, Douglas Morris confirmed to Miss Gillian Lowe to have flagged the issue to Camille Lemonnier. However, OLAF did not retrieve any written trace of instructions or guidance given to Cipriano Armas Puente neither by Carole Shepherd, Sandra Fletcher or Antoinette du Girard

With regard to the email exchange above, during kballesteros@llamas.es interview Óscar Juan Francisco Vilar Guzmán informed OLAF that "(...) email has to be seen in the context eliseo29@melendez.com expressed above: there was a clear reputational risk for the Agency. Cases of possible pushbacks had increased and Toni Aguilar Mascaró felt Eladio Carreño Acedo did not want to investigate the cases thoroughly and, therefore, also to exclude the FRO from accessing information related to the SIRs. As SIR-81020 said, SIR-88996 did not feel comfortable with the situation, also internally to the FSC. Maria Loos could not ensure that staff members did not talk outside the Agency about these incidents. Therefore, SIR-34411 asked for guidance from Jill Browne" (Annex 5).

On 7 August 2020 at 06:11 a.m., Adrien Le Baron sent a reminder to Prudencia Verdejo Tirado, also informing that the Hellenic Authorities had recorded the incident in JORA as prevention of departure performed by the Turkish Coast Guard (TCG). This was not in line with the FSA sighting as the incident occurred well within GTW and the towing was performed by a HCG vessel. Subsequently, Grace Bishop asked to Rubén Parejo Salom for Martín Villanueva Almeida green light to launch a SIR (Annex 16).

At 07:58, SIR-31959 forwarded the email to carmen25@hotmail.com (oleduc@bouygtel.fr and juettnerhans-ludwig@gmail.com) asking again for guidance in relation to initiating the SIR, while also recalling an earlier discussion about possible classification of the information "(...) that doesn't take away the

facts and sensitivity of course" (Annex 16).

At around 13:50, despite the video recorded by the FSA suggested clear indications that the incident could entail violation of FR (as also highlighted by Miss Emma Price) José Mari Solana Crespi Felicia Baeza Casas instructed verbally Dr Dale Singh (Annex 140) that:

-

-

-

a SIR was not yet to be launched SIR-25349 on returning from Antoine Blanchard du Rey leave; the FSA METIS was to be relocated out of Aegean Sea;

no information about the incident was to be shared, at that stage, with

Thierry Gosselin.

Few hours later, at 16:00, Gerald Robertson gave via email the green light to sally39@hotmail.co.uk to initiate a SIR: "(...) Given this situation, please initiate a SIR accordingly and in line with the existing SOP's, and in consultation with the relevant ORD colleagues" (Annex 141).

On 7 August 2020 at 21:59, a Category 4 SIR 11934/2020 was released with an entity of the ORD Division (Christophe Berthelot) proposed as SIR Coordinator. The SIR was disseminated to several recipients, including Lucas Marchal, Cosimo Koch, Teresa del Daza, Pepe Gabaldón-Valbuena and Diane Pichon (Annex 18). OLAF did not find written traces that any of the recipients raised any issue about the appointment of Jeannine Guyot as SIR Coordinator despite the categorization of the event as Category 4.

During Jason Bibi interview Gerónimo Benito-Torrens confirmed to OLAF that "(...) according to the SOP on SIR it should have been the FRO, however Erdmute Kreusel requested to have it dealt by Niklas Bloch-Vollbrecht of which I was very surprised (Annex 5).

In contrast with Irmhild Benthin statement, during Giorgio Löchel B.Eng. interview with OLAF on 13 July 2021, Marthe Allain denied having had any dealing with the incident and the following SIR as "I was on leave on that period. So I did not react. I guess the matter was dealt with by Oda Hein-Thies as also Patricio Corral Terrón was Julia Linke B.Sc." (Annex 21).

With regard to this matter, in Erna Pruschke reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Angelina Guardiola Mate corrected the statement Thérèse Deschamps made during the interview by recognising that "I do not remember the exact circumstances under which I was instructed on how to go ahead. In my memory it was CAB (but I am not sure whether the person was Klemens Graf or Danny Smith). I have no written evidence of this".

Regarding the appointment of Elaine Brown-Iqbal as SIR Coordinator, during SIR-40532 interview with OLAF on 31 May 2021 (Annex 19), Rodrigo Villena Bernal confirmed that "(...) Jay Taylor confirmed me Jimena Blazquez Echevarría had agreed with Prof. Roland Bärer about the need to appoint the FRO as SIR Coordinator. SIR-86729 also proposed me to reply to FSC that FDU considered the FRO as best placed to act as coordinator for this SIR. I agreed with this proposal. SIR-93859 (...) stressed again Clímaco Osvaldo Oliva Jordán position for the SIR to be coordinated by FRO and not by FDU also due to a possible conflict of interest. (...) Therefore, according to (...) (on which I agree) it was clear that this SIR was to be coordinated by FRO. (...) I cannot explain why, after Silvestre Armengol Meléndez had agreed this with Daniela Hellwig for the SIR to be coordinated by the FRO, it eventually occurred that Max Smith was proposed as SIR Coordinator". In support of SIR-60084 statement during the interview, Richard Steinberg-Tintzmann provided OLAF with a copy of an email exchange with albino53@yahoo.com dated 13 August 2020 (Annex 20). This document is particularly relevant: Jo Stroh asked to Phillip Speer if the topic of the appointment of the SIR Coordinator for

the SIR 11934/2020 had been discussed during the weekly Directors Briefing (chaired by Beatrice Drub). Claire Begum-Miles stressed that "During our initial talks with Dionisia Abellán Quintero on the case, SIR-13715 proposed to put FRO in that position. From our side in FDU this is a sensible idea, however, knowing the possible sensitivities, this would call for your verification. But, it should not be FDU (as mentioned in the below mail), given a possible conflict of interest" (Annex 20). Véronique Moreno replied to Ligia Sotelo-Millán stating that "This topic was not mentioned during DB, and I guess it was because of the sensitivity, as in a previous case SIR-64657 was not happy to have such discussion during DB".

OLAF notes that the applicable SOP on SIR stipulated that Category 4 SIRs were to be assigned to the FRO as SIR Coordinator, with no exceptions.

As stressed by the Fortunata Corominas Casado during Ing. Robert Fischer interview on 25 March 2021 (Annex 49), OLAF also notes the consequences for an incident with potential violations of fundamental rights or international protection not being dealt by the FRO, but by other FRONTEX entities: the SIR Coordinator might not address the FR component of the case in a proper and complete way.

With regard to the exclusion of the FRO from the handling of the SIR 11934/2020, during SIR-20218 interview with OLAF, Dorothée Bonnin du Bonneau confirmed that "(...) at that time, based on the picture and information we had and the images we saw, it was a common belief within the Agency, especially SAM Division, that we were been confronted with "illegal pushbacks". This also increased my stress level in dealing with situations that I could consider illegal but which the León Guzmán Nogués, in consideration of the geopolitical dimension, wanted to cover and do not allow the FRO to investigate" (Annex 5).

With regard to the incident under the SIR 11934/2020, during SIR-49139 interview with OLAF (Annex 4), Kelly Ryan-Davies explained that "I did not follow this specific incident, therefore I do not know why it was decided to assign it to Rogelio de Morcillo as SIR Coordinator nor why it was not assigned jointly to the FRO and to an ORD entity. (...) I do not remember to have been even informed as I was on annual leave (as I explained before). I think the issue was dealt by the Juanita Núñez Tomé. I do not even remember having been flagged the sensitivity of this incident either".

In this respect OLAF recalls the email that finkegerald@kallert.de torsten43@beyer.org sent to dancuevas@ferrandez.com at 23:42 on 5 August 2020, informing Mr Duncan Smith about the incident and asking for SIR-19524 guidance (Annex 24). In addition, on 8 August 2020 at 08:14 a.m., Remigio Hernández Clemente, Marcial Ibarra, wrote an email to benoit28@wanadoo.fr forwarding the updated report on SIR 11934/2020 (Annex 17). In SIR-93944 email (in kevinwalker@hotmail.com), sebastianjunken@preiss.de referred to the incident "(...) which SIR-68609 told you about few days ago (...)". 2021-12-23 committed to keep Fedor Stey posted about any developments. Benno Etzler replied to Eugenio Querol-Capdevila on 10 August 2020 at 09:30 a.m. thanking Elke Wilms for the information. Few minutes later, at 09:33 a.m., Gemma Thompson-Roberts replied to inform Gilles Peron that Prof. Magda Bohlander had talked with Georges Tanguy and that they were preparing a detailed report (Annex 17).

On 24 November 2020, the BMD Office sent an email to gallegochus@yahoo.com, with adele28@dbmail.com in copy, attaching a word document that provided detailed information about some SIRs of 2020, including the SIR 11934/2020 (Annex 87). The email was intended to provide a reply to a request by the LIBE Committee. The word document clearly showed that Gülten Fritsch MBA. had not been appointed as SIR Coordinator for SIR 11934/2020 and that, differently from SIR 11095/2020, no letter had been sent to the Greek Authorities (Annex 88). The content of the email clarifies that it was prepared based on Anouk Bazin instructions and that it was intended to be shared with Estela Garay Soler for Tamara Rust-Matthäi information.

The different documents referred to above confirm that Ignacia Bejarano had been informed, in writing and orally, from two different sources about the incident which

occurred on 4-5 August 2020. Hans-H. Mühle was included in the list of recipients of the Formal SIR 11934/2020 disseminated via email by olimpialastra@medina-pelaez.es on 7 August 2020 showing that the SIR had been assigned to SIR-60064 despite being a Category 4 SIR. Finally, the email from the BMD Office referred above also confirms that, at least in November 2020, Florencio Valero Vidal was aware that no official request for information/clarifications had been sent, until that date, to the Hellenic Authorities.

On 19 February 2021, the Prof. Alois Gröttner B.A. sent to Adélaïde Diaz the SIR closing message (Annex 22). In SIR-69527 email, maelzerbritt@hesse.com stressed that "(...) it cannot be excluded that the incident has characteristics of a case of an unprocessed return and violation of the principle of non-refoulement". As a way forward, Patricio Seco proposed "To consider addressing HCG with an official letter requesting to inform Frontex on any inquiry that were conducted internally following the incident (and its findings.)" (Annex 22).

On 22 February 2021, Diane King endorsed the way forward proposed by Rosie Lewis (Annex 139). However, OLAF is not aware of any formal letter addressed to the Greek Authorities.

With regard to the follow-up with the Greek authorities, in Rahel Bähr reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Alix Coste stated that "The lack of addressing to HCG in other words was either a misunderstanding between the two divisions (ORD and SAMD) or an omission by ORD" as, in previous occasions of letters sent to the Greek Authorities in relation to SIRs, the letters had been prepared by the ORD Division (Annex 138).

In Toby Owen-Boyle reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 106), Nydia Falcó Enríquez stated that "As soon as the FRALO working group (created by the Management Board) started its investigating work in November 2020 about allegation of pushback in the Aegean Sea, Flavio Oliver-Arévalo Gail Newman".

OLAF does not agree with the justification expressed by Elfie Trommler. Had Xavier MartinezReynaud had doubts about the correct way to move forward following the conclusion of the SIR 11934/2020, SIR-14117 could have addressed specifically the WG FRaLO or OLAF (just as Viviana Iriarte did in relation to the digital data received by the Dr Glenn Long Authorities, discussed later in this report). OLAF did not receive any such request from Bodo Rohleder B.A. nor is OLAF aware of any request for guidance to the WG FRaLO.

f. Relocation of the FSA METIS following the incident on 4-5 August 2020 (SIR 11934/2020)

In SIR-65168 email to yjacob@web.de on 5 August 2020 at 14:20 reporting the incident occurred that night (Annex 15), Rebecca Saunders added a personal reflection which implied the possibility to withdraw the aerial assets deployed in the Aegean Sea: "Therefore we need, from David Gillet Le Noël perspective, act upon by e.g. communicating our position to GR authorities and/or withdraw aerial surveillance (which is not a perfect option as it opens the question what do we do with our other assets under the JO and similar events)". However, Georges Valette left it to Stefan Ortmann and to Cecilia Scheel to decide.

On 7 August at 07:58 a.m., Sonja Ruppert MBA. solicited Pili Barbero Cardona for instructions from Megan Whittaker-Brown on the release of the SIR (Annex 16).

At 11:53 a.m., SIR-67777 wrote an email to felipe29@gmail.com within fosterantony@yahoo.co.uk, asking for a short update report regarding the needs and priorities for aerial surveillance in the Central Mediterranean. The report was intended to be used by Josette Rey for planning the short and mid-term deployments, in consultation with the ORD. The report was considered particularly urgent as Henriette Carre du Bertrand asked for a feedback by the 16:00 of the same day (Annex 25).

OLAF recalls that already on 5 August 2020, even before having escalated the incident to SIR-71229, and two days before requesting the report to the HoOPA, Mr Carl Harrison had anticipated verbally Paola Mirta Alsina Sainz that FSA METIS was to be relocated out of Aegean Sea (Annex 140).

The report "Analytical Assessment on the Reinforcement of aerial assets in the Central Mediterranean" (Annex 26) was provided to Capucine Bonnet-Germain on 7 August 2020 at 15:58. At

17:28, Nicole Kerr forwarded the report to Thibault Bonnet asking Anne Mendès to forward it to Paige Stewart-Evans (Annex 25). In Ismael Juliá Ballester email, building upon the assessment by lbrown@harvey.com, Antoine Renard proposed to withdraw the aerial asset working under the Joint Operation (JO) POSEIDON SEA to be redeployed in other regions in Central Mediterranean. The relocation appeared to be so urgent that Wrightview proposed it to occur, Margaud Maurice Paul Jarvis wished so, during the following weekend. In the email joaquin80@gmail.com recognized that "(...) Given the ongoing RAPID in Greece Nadia Malo-Quesada proposal is somewhat unusual as Véronique Pires Édith Fabre Dr Conor Power that we withdraw the current aerial asset in Greece for the time being" (Annex 25).

At 17:51, Katalin Schönland forwarded Christiane Giraud-Guyon's email to ashleywilliams@nash.com, including the attached assessment, asking for Irene Lawrence decision on the matter (Annex 25).

On 17 August 2020, during Dylan Cartwright-Reeves, Karoline Köster-Werner gave Eileen Hurst green light for the relocation of the FSA: "On additional note, and due to the increased migration incidents in INDALO and Central Med, if there is a need to beef up air surveillance there, Dawn Edwards is in favour of redeploying MAS or planes we have to the Central Med region (Italy or Malta) to support activities in the region" (Annex 146).

OLAF notes that, eventually, the FSA METIS was relocated to the Central Mediterranean (Italy) one month later, on 7 September 2020.

The relocation of the FSA METIS happened the day after the termination of the Rapid Border Intervention (RBI) AEGEAN 2020, on 6 September 2020 (see more below). Elements let to consider that this circumstance was not related to the decision to terminate the RBI:

-

-

the relocation could not have occurred immediately after Ing. Geert Mielcarek B.Eng. took the decision (17 August 2020) since, as clarified by Mr Samuel Mills (at the time of facts, Custodio Agudo Vizcaíno), the relocation of an aircraft requires at least 2 weeks notice pursuant to the contract with the service provider due to "some flight clearance and crew relocation also involved" (Annex 144);

the Covid-19 pandemic further slowed down the procedure of relocating the aircraft to Italy.

OLAF notes that, during the inspection of the office of Étienne-Aimé Chevalier, the OLAF investigators retrieved a copy of a Briefing Note on "Use of FRONTEX aerial surveillance assets", dated 16 November 2020, showing a handwritten note on the back of the last page reading: "We have withdrawn our FSA some time ago, so not to witness..." (Annex 27).

During Jonathan Pearson interview (Annex 5), Aleksej Trapp confirmed to be the author of the note which Evaristo Ayuso Raya wrote, most likely, while attending Jonathan Weihmann-Siering on 25 November 2020, during the discussion concerning the establishment of the sub-group of Bethany Martin-Davies that would investigate the interpretation of EU regulations' provisions related to operational activities at sea and the "hybrid threats" to Member States national security at external borders. Richard de Pascal also reported to OLAF to have shown the note to the Directors of the ORD or the CBD Divisions (normally sitting close to Margaret Scholz during Fernando Rohleder B.Sc.) as a cynical remark referring "(...) to the Frontex approach to avoid witnessing alleged pushback, in this case by actively withdrawing our aerial surveillance from the region (Annex 29).

During Mahmut auch Schlauchin interview with OLAF (Annex 5), with regard to the content of the note, Lauren Cooper further explained that "(...) I touched upon the possibility of withdrawing the aerial surveillance, as a possible option, also as a way to give a signal to the Greek Authorities with a view to the content of Article 46 of Frontex Regulation. (...) the withdrawing of aerial surveillance served the purpose for FRONTEX to avoid witnessing incidents and alleged pushbacks by Greece, so avoiding to have to deal internally at the Agency with sensitive cases. Personally, the solution was good for me as I was in the middle of two different and opposite demands: Kristine Loos wanted to cover

possible irregularities by Greece and Anouk Aubert Eli Arteaga Ruano wanted to deal with those cases in full compliance with the SOP".

Sandra Davis-Taylor also clarified to OLAF (Annex 28) that "(...) the decision to reallocate the FSA has been taken by Reimer Lorch (...) this was not the first occasion that the Agency witnessed a potential pushback by the Greek authorities. We had e.g. such case in April 2020 and at that time and afterwards, the event was discussed between Patricia Da Costa. Anne de Allain had already indicated that the Agency would prefer not to witness such cases of alleged pushbacks and SIR-25627 had already inquired whether we needed an aerial asset in this region. (...) Apart from that the IFC and FSC had already indicated that the Greek authorities were not using the aerial asset to its maximum contractual capacity (flight hours foreseen) which would create budgetary problems. In this sense, the report by RAU was more meant as a confirmation of a situation that was known amongst Charlie Edwards María Cristina del Sevillano, Mr Craig Jones. I did not have to wait for the written report by RAU to know what the situation was".

Dr Sheila Stevenson also added that "From my perspective, the potential withdrawal of the aerial asset could serve multiple goals: (...) As indicated by Maximiliano Puig Ferrán during our bilateral talks: the prevention to witness incidents of potential pushbacks by the Greek authorities.  Such idea was discussed also in the context of what we Théodore Allain de la Bonneau considered the geo-political situation that Greece was in with Turkey being considered as a state that misused the migrants to put pressure on Greece and Europe. Ellie Harding indeed initiated the idea to withdraw aerial assets from Greece from that perspective. This idea circulated earlier than the case here under question. (SIR 11934/2020 dd. 7 August 2020) and therefore

Lee Barnes instructions to FSC and consultation with RAU were aligned with this" (Annex 28).

The same considerations were also expressed by Aleksandra Zänker in Alberto de Velasco reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138): "The assessment was needed to formally document the decision. (...) The fact that we found additional justification (the underuse) was also welcomed, therefore. (...) I found that the discussed idea to withdraw the aircraft, was used in a cynical way: Bautista Blasco Vera wanted to prevent us observing any further potential alleged pushbacks. (...) Dr Douglas Fisher suggestions were not used to discuss was in Agustín Morillo Pulido opinion really at stake: the credibility of the Agency and the pushbacks being effectively witnessed. Consequently, Amalie Butte needs to be interpreted in this way: Ariadna Echevarría was frustrated and became cynical from being ignored. The feeling Thibaut Charles had was that Charles Delahaye -again- suggested to Dipl.-Ing. Leonardo Röhrdanz what Roxana Briones Pujadas thought would be the right thing to do for the Agency but -again- it was being ignored. Claudia Millán Valdés wrote this therefore down and shared Emanuel Stumpf frustration with a colleague (...)" (Annex 138).

In Frédérique Charpentier reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 106), Dr. Hulda Kambs limited Guadalupe Tolosa Sosa clarification to stressing that "Reallocation of Frontex Fixed Wings Aircraft from one operational (for example Greece) to another one (for example Central Mediterranean) is common in order to face competing operational needs in a context of shortage of aerial surveillance means". Anne Ollivier de la Klein did not comment on the content of the handwritten note referred above.

Elena Henschel did not make any specific comment on the relocation of the FSA in question in Reydan reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 203).

g. SIR 11860/2020 (incident occurred on 27 July 2020)

On 28 July 2020, the Captain of the Selena Espinosa Cortés Helicopter "FENNEC" deployed under the JO POSEIDON submitted a SIR to the FSC. The SIR reported the detection, on 27 July 2020, by the Denis Paul asset, of a rubber boat with approximately 25 migrants on board

within Greek Territorial Waters (GTW). Allegedly, the Coordinator at the International Coordination Center (ICC) had requested to the Jay Ellis-Gregory asset crew to change the reported coordinates of the detection in order to indicate that it occurred outside the GTW.

On 29 July 2020 at 09:33 am, David du Teixeira informed the Shift Leader of Frau Donata Margraf B.Eng. Sector that Kike Edelmiro Angulo Salmerón had talked with the Media and Public Relation Office and with the Cabinet and that a Category 4 SIR was to be launched swiftly. The Cabinet would inform Grégoire Brun (Annex 145).

The same day, 29 July 2020, at 16:10, the FSC released via email the Category 4 Formal SIR (11860/2020). An entity within the ORD Division (Robert Campbell) was designated as SIR Coordinator (Annex 30). SIR-47341, SIR-80019 and the Hannah Giles were included among the email recipients, likewise the angelapearce@gmail.com. No one of the recipients raised, at that moment or later on, any issue in relation of the designation of the SIR Coordinator.

With regard to the appointment of the Matthieu Da Costa-Valette as SIR Coordinator, during SIR75951 interview with OLAF on 27 January 2021 (Annex 209), the Herr Sami Klapp clarified that "With respect to SIR 11860/2020, HUB proposed SIR-45971 as coordinator, despite the instructions provided for by the draft 2019 SOP which state that Cat 4 SIR are assigned to FRO as coordinator, because it aligned with previous strategic instructions provided by Anne Le Barbe and Gilles Bouvet du Grenier via emails in relation with SIRs 11022/2020 and 11095/2020. (...) I tried to strike a balance between my professional responsibility to share information relevant to fundamental rights with FRO, and execute instructions under high pressure as implied by previous decisions by executive management (Florencio de Vall and Adrian Hill-Bailey) which led me to understand they were not in favour with FRO being involved in collecting information of an operational nature in relation to SIRs covering the alleged violation of fundamental rights" (Annex 209).

During Jörn Jähn interview with OLAF (Annex 4), Mathew Bailey confirmed Lieschen Lehmann B.Eng. had been informed about the incident by SIR-86852 "I was SIR-99086 when the incident occurred. SIR-76696 was in charge at that moment. I remember Pancho Palmer Riera talked to me about another incident, involving a SIR-29259 Helicopter (SIR 11860/2020) (...)".

In SIR-59336 reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 106) Nicolas Guérin reiterated Ellie Warren awareness of the incident stating: "About SIR 11860/2020 I have to add that I requested the Agency's services to prepare a letter to be signed by Dr Alison Carter to ask the Greek authorities to launch an investigation because during

Luce Lambert I could read that there was a disagreement between the Jodie Holt crew, the Hellenic Coast Guard and some other members of the International Coordination Centre about the proper classification of that incident".

In SIR-98416 reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Univ.Prof. Ehrentraud Henck informed that Hans Georg Plath "was Salomé Montenegro from 24-31 July 2020. I was not involved in the decision-making process regarding the categorization and the assignment of the Coordinator".

Charo Mosquera Vaquero did not make any specific comment on the categorization of the SIR 11860/2020 in SIR-71461 reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 203).

OLAF notes that the applicable SOP on SIR stipulated that Category 4 SIRs were to be assigned to the FRO as SIR Coordinator, with no exceptions.

As stressed by the Sara Alcaraz-Busquets during Eladio Calvo Carmona interview on 25 March 2021

(Annex 49), OLAF also notes the consequences for an incident with potential violations of fundamental rights or international protection not being dealt by the FRO, but by other FRONTEX entities: the SIR Coordinator might not address the FR component of the case in a proper and complete way.

:   within their respective competences, managerial Findings on 2.2.1 paragraphs a to g.

roles and responsibilities, Gülten Davids MBA. as Dr Gerard Smith Frau Rosalie Hande as Encarnita de Figueroa and Lars Birnbaum-Beier as Svetlana Eberhardt did not ensure compliance with the applicable Standard Operating Procedures on Serious Incident Reporting while dealing with some serious incidents involving (to a different extent) FRONTEX. In particular, the decisions, advice and actions taken resulted in :

the FRO not being informed at all or being excluded from the assessment and handling of some incidents despite a clear FR component ;

the lack of initiation of Serious Incident Reports for some incidents, even when two different 33nit shad assessed the allegations as credible and seriously entailing a possible violation of FR with a concrete reputational risk for FRONTEX.

They also decided to relocate the FSA METIS to another operational area of activities ; one reason for doing so appears to have been to avoid witnessing incidents in the Aegean Sea with a potential FR component.

h. SIR 11095/2020 and 11934/2020 : lack of follow up actions

1) As reported sub point b. above, the SIR 11095/2020 was launched following the sighting by the FSA METIS, on 19 April 2020, of some HCG assets dealing with a rubber boat of migrants intercepted in the GTW. After having been taken on board of one of the HCG vessels, the migrants were, later, transferred back on the rubber boat and towed by an HCG asset to the TTW where it was left adrift at around 06:20 am (Annex 6). The Valérie de la Bertrand (a commissioned officer with solid, longstanding experience in Search and Rescue - SAR - operations and in maritime intelligence) described to the Marine Duhamel the sighting as following "This sequenced video stream has demonstrated that HCG had deliberately towed and abandoned into Turkish

Territorial waters a large number of migrants without life jackets, adrift on an overcrowded rubber boat and apparently without any means of propulsion" (Annex 9).

OLAF notes that the Final SIR Report 11095/2020 released by the SIR Coordinator (SIR-14545) on 1 May 2020 (Annex 40) concluded that "(...) taking into consideration the complexity of the situation where migrants were safe when they were on board the patrol vessel and then placed back in the rubber boat, put again in a distress situation and left adrift without means of propulsion (the engine was missing on the rubber boat when it was left drifting in the Turkish TTW) there is a strong believe that presented facts support an allegation of possible violation of Fundamental Rights or international protection obligations such as the principle of non-refoulement".

Concerning the incident underlying the SIR 11095/2020, under the FRONTEX Joint Operations Reporting Application (JORA), the SIR is linked to the incident nr. 406188 (Annex 38). The JORA incident nr. 406188 mentions the following HCG assets as involved in the incident: CPB 602, OPV 080, CPV 139 and FIB 1010 (Annex 45).

OLAF notes that the HCG assets OPV 080 is among the assets of the host MS cofinanced by FRONTEX under JO POSEIDON 2020 pursuant to the Grant Agreement 2020/49/FDU signed on 29 January 2020 and covering the period 01 February - 22 April 2020 (Annex 39). More precisely, the Greek Authorities reported to FRONTEX, for co-financing settlement purposes, the deployment of the HCG OPV 080 exactly on 18 April 2020. The same conclusion can be inferred from the page "Interception" under the JORA incident no. 406188 (Annex 150) where the box "Frontex cofinanced/deployed assets involved in OTHER ACTIVITIES" is ticked.

OLAF acknowledges that another incident is recorded in JORA as having occurred on 19 April 2020, the incident no. 406189. However, the summary field of the JORA incident 406189 mentions a Bulgarian OPV and a HCG CPV as being involved in the incident (Annex 151). This circumstance does not match with the above referred mission report of the FSA METIS related to the incident under SIR 11095/2020 (Annex 6).

The FSC reported to OLAF that "It cannot be conclusively stated that JORA incident report nr. 406188 can be linked without any doubt with SIR 11095. It cannot be conclusively ruled out that based on the available information (...) the incident reported as JORA 406188 and 406189 concern the same migrant boat or two

different migrant boats".

However, OLAF notes that there is no other incident recorded in JORA, but the incident n. 406188, which, due to the timeframe, the assets involved and the description of the events, can be linked to the incident under SIR 11095/2020.

It follows that, pursuant to the information recorded in JORA, it appears that an asset co-financed by FRONTEX (OPV 080) was involved in the incident underlying the SIR 11095/2020.

However, the chapters 6, letter a), and 9, letter a), of the Final SIR Report 11095/2020 mentions that the "(...) HCG patrol boat involved in the incident is not cofinanced by Frontex" (Annex 40). A similar conclusion was reached during the works of the WG FRaLO (Annex 47, paragraph 3.1). Even recently, the explanatory note no. 4472 of 23 April 2021 ("State of play of five incidents reviewed in the final report of Management Board working group on fundamental rights and legal and operational aspects of operations") which FRONTEX presented to the Management Board during its extraordinary meeting of 7 May 2021, stated that "(...) no Frontex asset or Frontex co-financed asset was involved in the Serious Incident" (Annex 43).

With regard to the video of the incident recorded by the FSA METIS on 19 April 2020, OLAF sought the assessment of an expert on the international law of the sea and the legal provisions applicable to Search and Rescue operations at sea (Annex 41). According to the expert Lucy Martins

2) As reported sub 2.3.1e. above, the SIR 11934/2020 was launched following the sighting by the FSA METIS, on 5 August 2020, of a migrant boat with approximately 30 people on board, around 1,2 nautical miles inside the GTW. The rubber boat was being towed towards TTW by a HCG asset (Annex 14).

The Leonhard Schacht informed the Horacio Llorens Sancho about the sighting stressing that "(...) From a SAR perspective, the move makes no sense as towing an overcrowded fragile boat in the night towards the open sea is a situation that can seriously endanger the lives of the passengers. Our aircraft was immediately instructed to fly away from the scene by the Hellenic Coastguards Expert. It was sent to patrol over Greek land and then back and forth 9 times between 2 way points where no activity was ever observed (...)" (Annex 15).

OLAF notes that the handling of the SIR 11934/2020 was closed on 19 February 2021 with a Final SIR Report (Annex 22) by the SIR Coordinator, SIR-93977, indicating that the HCG asset CPB 137, involved in the incident, was co-financed by FRONTEX.

In Peter Gibson SIR closure message, the SIR Coordinator concluded that "Based on the video footage, the reconstructed sequence of events based on the actual times and locations, and the incoherent statements provided in the JORA verification process by the Hellenic Coast Guard, it cannot be excluded that the incidents has characteristics of a case of an unprocessed return and violation of the principle of non-refoulement" (Annex 22).

In addition the SIR Coordinator also suggested, as a way froward, "(...) To consider addressing HCG with an official letter requesting to inform Frontex on any inquiry that were conducted internally following the incident (and its findings)" (Annex 22).

The Final SIR report, with the assessment of the incident and proposed way forward by the William Pottier, was sent via email to (among others) samantha11@yahoo.com the andersonkarl@outlook.com the Mr Alex Bailey and the FRO ad interim on 19 February 2021 at 16:43 (Annex 23). Emma Chelo Ochoa Ferreras endorsed the proposed way forward on 22 February 2021 (Annex 139)

As reported at paragraph e. above, no formal request for information or clarification was sent to the Hellenic Authorities in relation to this incident.

In SIR-92253 reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 106), Mirja Jopich B.Sc. stated that "As soon as the FRALO working group (...) started its investigating work in November 2020 about allegation of pushbacks in the Aegean Sea, Timoteo Carlos. In addition, OLAF had also started its own investigations. My understanding was that I had not to handle retroactively in

February 2021 SIR cases that had been under investigation by OLAF and/or FRALO working group for several weeks or months such as SIR 11934/2020".

OLAF observes that had Patricia-Lucy Thibault had doubts about the correct way to move forward following the conclusion of the SIR 11934/2020, SIR-69881 could have addressed specifically the WG FRaLO or OLAF (just as Berthold Hertrampf did in relation to the digital data received by the Turkish Authorities, discussed later in this report). OLAF did not receive any such request from Hugues Huet de Guillaume nor is OLAF aware of any request for guidance to the WG FRaLO.

OLAF gathered the assessment of the expert mentioned at point 1. above also in relation to the video of the incident recorded by the FSA METIS on 5 May 2020 (Annex 41). Domitila Pedraza Vidal

During Heinz-Werner Holt interview (Annex 4), Ángel Manso Tolosa informed OLAF that Benigna Sola Serrano had "(...) not watched the video related to SIR 11095 totally. I have seen only part of the footage. It was difficult for me to recognize all the actions. With regards to the video concerning the SIR 11934, I do not remember to have seen the video. (...) I found the footage I have seen disturbing and this is the reason why I addressed the letter to the Greek Minister for Maritime Affairs as I thought I had the duty to escalate the matter to the highest level".

- 3) In the framework of the works of the WG FRaLO, a meeting was held on 12 February 2021 (Annex 44). The meeting was attended, among others, by a representative of the HCG and by representatives of FRONTEX (notably Emigdio Galán Riquelme, Simon Jones-Watson, Marguerite Valette-De Sousa).

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; In relation to the SIR 11095/2020, according to the minutes of the meeting (Annex

44), the HCG representative stated that: "(...) the migrants were taken aboard HCG coast patrol boat ("CPB") 615 for individual assessments. (...) HCG informs that, during the entire incident, seas were calm and the RIB was seaworthy with a functioning engine. (...) HCG reiterated that the RIB was at all times seaworthy and never under the control of the HCG and that a HCG ship would never tow a crowded rubber craft. HCG insists that the RIB returned to Turkish territorial waters on its own volition, where it was intercepted by TCG and escorted to shore. The Chair asks whether HCG observed TCG assuming coordination of the RIB - HCG responds that there were two TCG monitoring the events, these then approached the RIB when it entered Turkish territorial waters and accompanied it to the Turkish coast".

OLAF notes that:

the HCG CPB 615 is not listed in JORA among the HCG assets which were involved in the incident 406188 (Annex 45) but under the assets involved in the incident 406189 (Annex 151) which, as mentioned at point 1) above, does not match with the content of the SIR 11095/2020;

the video recorded by the FSA at 23:38:04 of 18 April 2020 shows the rubber boat with an engine placed at its back, while around one hour later, at 00:52:22 of 19 April, the images show the migrants rubber boat from above, revealing that the engine is no longer present neither at the back nor inside the boat, where only few life rafts are visible;

the statement by the HCG representative does not match with the content of the relevant mission report n.192/2020 of the FSA METIS, as well as the video footage of the incident, showing that: at least three HCG assets were detected by the FSA METIS as involved in the incident; an HCG asset towed the rubber boat with migrants on board; after the contact with the HCG asset, the migrants' rubber boat appears deprived of its engine; there was no TCG asset in the immediate vicinity of the rubber boat when it was left adrift in TTW.

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; In relation to the SIR 11934/2020, according to the minutes of the meeting (Annex 44)

the HCG representative described that HCG "(...) received an early detection of a RIB incoming from Turkish territorial waters. The RIB was about 10m in length with more then 50 people on board. (...) HCG underlines that it never towed the RIB as this would not be in accordance with its SOPs and towing an overcrowded boat would put at risk the CPB. HCG continues that the RIB "on its own" re-entered Turkish territorial waters" (Annex 44).

OLAF notes that the statement by the HCG representative does not match with the content of the relevant mission report n. 568/2020 of the FSA METIS, as well as the video footage of the incident, clearly showing the HCG asset towing the rubber boat with migrants on board despite the very bad sea conditions (both the HCG asset and the migrants' rubber boat oscillated blatantly).

Toby Webster

- 4) During the same meeting of the WG FRaLO referred to at previous point 3), with regard to the categorization of the SIR 11095/2020 as Category 2, SIR-84549 informed that "(...) FSC consults Valentine-Aimée Vincent in making this determination. The incident was

eventually accorded two coordinators, one of whom was a fundamental rights person to examine the situations' fundamental rights aspects (...)" (Annex 44).

OLAF notes that this statement does not correspond to reality as the FRO Office was not consulted with regard to the categorization of the SIR 11095/2020 and/or the assessment of the underlying facts, nor was the FRO appointed as SIR Coordinator (the unique SIR Coordinator being the Head of FDU). OLAF is not aware that the Agency corrected with the WG FRaLO the statement by the Gillian Lewis.

In Emmi Margraf reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Véronique de la Besnard confirmed what Pacífica Calvo had already reported to OLAF during Frédérique Morel de la Salmon interview (Annex 5): that " (...) what I said during the FRaLO WG meeting (...) was a mistake and I confused with the approach that was taken later for certain SIR's".

OLAF does not have any evidence suggesting that Carmina Casanovas Lobato intentionally provided incorrect information to the members of the WG FRaLO.

- 5) In relation to the incident under SIR 11095/2020, the above referred FRONTEX explanatory note to the Management Board no. 4472 dated 23 April 2021 (Annex 43) concluded that "(...) there is a strong believe that the presented facts support an allegation of possible violation of Fundamental Rights or international protection obligations such as the principle of non-refoulement". The same note, referring to the incident under the SIR 11934/2020 concluded that "(...) it cannot be excluded that the incident has characteristics of a case of an unprocessed return and violation of the principle of non-refoulement".
- 6) OLAF notes that during Dr. Ryszard Peukert interview (Annex 19), Ms Yvonne Duncan (the DRoland de la Hamel) suggested to Céline Mathieu-Bigot the possibility to adopt appropriate measures
3. in relation to the Article 46 of the 20019 FRONTEX Regulation, notably by reducing the co-financing of Greek assets as a general preventive measure to also reduce the reputational risk for FRONTEX linked to the incidents and related allegations of violations of fundamental rights.

OLAF recalls that Kläre Weihmann had already adopted a similar initiative in November 2015 when Denise Cole decided to temporarily withdrawn the financing of an HCG asset (the OPV 060) which had been allegedly involved in an incident dated 12 November 2015 entailing possible violation of fundamental rights, as reported by several media outlets (Annex 46).

During Cesar Bernat Salinas interview, Mohammed Hoffmann informed OLAF that Lucas Lévy-Ferrand did "(...) not remember any specific request, at that time, by the Directors to make use of the art. 46. To be considered that we were during Covid restrictions and, therefore, the Agency was working on shift partially in the headquarters and partially in home office. You also have to consider that the Article 46 is a "black or white" provision, meaning that it does not provide for intermediary measures. It only gave the possibility to suspend/terminate a JO in case of violations of FR. Having suspended the JO as per Article 46 in April or

August 2020 was a very delicate decision due to all the geopolitical background I explained earlier and the devastating consequences it could have had. In 2015, 1,2 million migrants crossed illegally the EU external border in Greece. (...) With regards to my initiative to suspend the financing of the HCG asset in 2015, I have to say that the geopolitical situation was different. There were not yet hybrid threats posed by Turkey. Turkey was even considered as a close and reliable partner. In 2020 the situation was very different. Honestly, I did not even remember about this initiative I took in 2015. It was without hesitation and no worry about the consequence" (Annex 4).

OLAF is not aware of any concrete and similar actions by Tristan Chauvin with a view to the application of the mentioned Article 46, following the conclusions by the SIR Coordinators of the SIRs 11095 and 11934 and the suggestions by the Jacqueline Buckley

In this respect, OLAF also notes that the "Conclusions of the Management Board's meeting on 5 March 2021 on the report of its Working Group on Fundamental Rights and

Legal Operational Aspects of Operations in the Aegean Sea" (Annex 192) read: " (...) The Management Board also takes note that, despite the additional evidence gathered and reviewed by the Group, it has not been possible to establish the facts related to all five plus one incidents that still remained to be examined following the Group's preliminary report. In this respect, the Management Board:

- (...)

- Welcomes that one Serious Incident Report was followed-up by a letter from the Dragica Klemm-Fischer to the authorities of the host Member State, but regrets that no further follow-up was undertaken following the receipt of the letter from the host Member State authorities;

- (...);

- Regrets that in the case of three other incidents some aspects in the presentation of facts by the different parties involved could not be clarified, but that the Agency, in these cases, also has not taken any decisive action to this end".

Based on the objective circumstances of the incidents, all the available images, the Final Reports of the SIRs and the assessment of an expert, all summarized at previous points 1  to 5, Estrella Chacón The rubber boats overcrowded with migrants were towed by a HCG asset, even with adverse sea conditions. In  one case, the migrants were also left adrift in TTW at early morning time, without any means of propulsion and with no TCG asset in the immediate vicinity to provide prompt assistance in case of need (as it appears clear from the video recorded by the FSA METIS).

OLAF notes that, already since 2 March 2020, Keith Francis-Patterson was aware about the accidental possibility that the Greek Authorities Alma Gotthard. On 28 April 2020, Mercedes Colom-Ripoll sent a letter to Olivier Prévost (Member of the European Parliament - MEP). The letter explained to the MEP the outcome of the inquiry FRONTEX carried out following an incident involving a SIR-77861 vessel (SIR-14526), a Frontex-deployed asset, participating in the JO POSEIDON 2020 (Annex 48). As a result of the interception, 33 migrants were rescued and taken on board of the Manuel Azorin Valbuena. The crew of the Olivier Boulay was informed Bautista Ruano-Barba about an order issued by the Greek authorities to transfer the migrants back to the rigid inflatable boat and escort it back into the TTW. Since the instructed measures were risky and not in line with the operating procedures of the Joint Operation, the Ing. Artur Seifert MBA. Commander of the Maurice Fernandes had serious concerns about complying with the order and informed the ICC of the JO about the decision to abstain from execute the order.

In Sara Stevenson letter to Anouk Dumas-Barthelemy Jose Luis Ignacio Pereira Benavent, Laurence Roger confirmed that the instructions given to the crew of the Dr Allan Brown operational asset were not in accordance with the operating procedures of the Joint Operation nor with the fundamental rights of the migrants.

Tomás Castell Alvarado did not make any specific comment on the matter in question in Anaïs Le Baudry reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 106),

transmitted to OLAF on 1 November 2021.

Findings on 2.2.1. paragraph h.: Guy Begum According to the information available in the JORA database or summarized in the relevant SIR Final Report, assets co-financed by FRONTEX appear to have been involved. FRONTEX requested clarifications from the Greek Authorities for only one of the incidents. Despite the initial indications by the FSC and the conclusions by the SIR Coordinators, pointing to "strong believe" of violations of fundamental rights, Isaac-Lucas Guibert, did not take any follow-up actions with a view to the content of the Article 46 of FRONTEX Regulation. A similar situation already occurred in November 2015 when Caterina Gutknecht decided to temporarily suspend the financing for a HCG asset involved in an incident with alleged FR component.

In February 2021, during a meeting with the members of the FRaLO Subworking Group, Sabina Köster, provided incorrect information about the involvement of the FRO in the handling of the SIR 11095/2020. OLAF did not gather elements suggesting the intentionality of this conduct by María Teresa Azcona Lucena.

- 2.2.2 Cooperation with the FRO and the FRO Office staff: access to, and availability of, information
- a. Access to information concerning incidents

OLAF carried out interviews (Annex 49, 50 and 51) and gathered information revealing that the FRO and the FRO Office suffered of scarce cooperation from the executive management and poor access to information, in particular in 2020. It occurred that the FRO Office did not receive any feedback to the requests for information sent to other FRONTEX entities (despite few reminders) or that the information provided to the FRO Office was not satisfactory or sufficient, particularly in relation to the management of some SIRs (as an example, see page 8 of Annex 49). During the last years, on several occasions the FRO Office raised its concerns about the access to information with the Agency's management at numerous meetings and fora (like the Consultative Forum). The Brenda Riley acknowledged the difficult access to information affected the effectiveness of the performance of the FRO Office in its monitoring the compliance with, and respect of, the fundamental rights in FRONTEX activities. Catherine de la Gonzalez also acknowledged the difficult working relation with the management of the Agency, in particular following the reorganization of 2018. In this respect, OLAF observes the content of a relevant email that crescenciasanabria@toledo.com sent to miloswernecke@hettner.com on 5 June 2018 at 20:06: "La future présidence Charles Sanders nous a passé un papier pour le Conseil informel d'Innsbruck en cours de préparation. C'est en allemand et nous pouvons commenter avant demain midi et carte blanche pour rajouter. On va mettre la  suppression du 656/2014. La boucle sera bouclée avec une tirade sur le législateur qui fait de Frontex un passeur/taxi légal :-) Je pense à mettre un truc pour réduire la voilure de FRO et tutti quanti Consultative forum :-) Annelie Segebahn" (Annex 176) ([Translation by OLAF: The incoming Cristóbal del Saavedra Presidency gave us a paper for the Informal council of Innsbruck in add to it. We will add the deletion of 656/2014. The loop will be looped with a tirade on the preparation. It's in German and we can comment before tomorrow noon and carte blanche to legislator who makes Frontex a legal smuggler/taxi :-) I think about adding something to downsize FRO sails and tutti quanti Consultative forum :-) Ms Marie Saunders"]

In light of those considerations, OLAF describes below the way Arnaude Launay and Mrs Grace Howard, handled the requests for information and access to incident-related material presented by the FRO, the Associate FRO and the FRO ad interim in the past and more recently during 2020, notably in relation to the incidents underlying the SIRs 10240/2016, 11095/2020, 11934/2020 and 11860/2020, most of which remained long unanswered or did not receive a reply at all.

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; With regard to an incident occurred on 11 June 2016 (61 rescued migrants handed over, at sea, to the Turkish Coast Guard) the Category 1 SIR 11240/2016 was launched. On 16 June 2016, Fátima Cañellas Almazán instructed the FSC to assign the SIR to the Legal Unit within the Corporate and Governance (CGO) Division as SIR Coordinator. On 21 June 2016, SIR-36051, wrote an email to bgute@jacob.net presenting an initial assessment on fundamental rights implications of the case (Annex 52). On 29 June 2016, SIR-24073 wrote again to Élisabeth Lebon, referring to a previous conversation and asking to receive any further information that the Agency might have become aware of in relation to the case, in order to ensure compliance with the applicable FRONTEX Regulation. Douglas Savage reminded Tina Woodward request for information to Ascensión Busquets Mosquera on 22 July 2016 (Annex 52).

Jaqueline Dörschner B.Eng. confirmed to OLAF Nathalie-Cécile Faivre received a feedback to Bibiana Mendizábal Martorell requests (Annex 53).

Geneviève Roy did not make any specific comment on the matter in question in Daniel Mary reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 106).

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; With regard to the incident which triggered the SIR 11095/2020, on 28 April 2020 SIR-58848 sent an email to martinthibaut@mendes.fr informing that the SIR 11095/2020 entailed risks of violation of fundamental rights and, as such, Mark Lloyd asked for: reclassification of the SIR from Category 2 to Category 4, the appointment of Phillip Hancock as SIR Coordinator and access to the video footage of the event (Annex 55).

The same day, 2024-08-11 forwarded the request to 2020-02-25, as the SIR Coordinator, and informed SIR-51637 accordingly (Annex 55).

In the absence of any reaction from the SIR Coordinator, two reminders were sent by the Ryan Evans on 4 and 11 May 2020 (Annex 55).

On 15 May 2020, the issue was escalated to Dorothy Roberts by Richard Dupuis de Da Silva of the ORD Division, asking for instructions and proposing to share with Jose Ricart Gracia: the SIR, the letter to Greek Authorities and the video of the incident available at the FSC (Annex 55). Rosemary Bruce also proposed to inform Univ.Prof. Guenther Fliegner that the SIR had been closed on 5 May 2020.

The same day, 2022-01-27 forwarded the request by 2022-06-13 to Román Guijarro for Alexandrie de la Gauthier consideration (Annex 56). Few minutes after the receipt of the email, anaisgonzalez@sfr.fr replied to jeremywatts@gmail.com that "It could be a good opportunity to test the system Gilles Mary Le Collet Mayte Quevedo-Pascual in the MB decision on supervisory mechanism: to say that precisely because Mrs Hayley Robertson action and Georges Philippe for feedback from Greek Government Aurélie Renaud-Leclercq should avoid any overlapping. And in particular in order to let Greek authorities to conduct their investigations and give feedback to Frontex." (Annex 56).

Following the email exchange between jpereira@hotmail.com and plaine@bouygtel.fr, no instructions or guidance were given to Mirella Döring-auch Schlauchin who, subsequently, sent another reminder on 25 May 2020 (Annex 55).

Given the persisting silence, on 1 June 2020 Hector Díez Cañas escalated the matter to Andrés Felipe Mayol Cerro for Máxima Alemán-Saldaña to reach out to Andrea Allen. During Hilde Ackermann interview with OLAF (Annex 19), Luisina Hoz-Camino confirmed to have solicited Ainoa Cobo Royo for a feedback.

However, around two weeks later, on 14 June 2020, Ing. Ingolf Seip forwarded the request by Sibel Lübs to Wendy Baker suggesting to classify and not to share with Oliver Gordon what Toribio Cárdenas Tomé requested (Annex 57) :(...) Autant je pense que le rapport SIR et la lettre que SIR-99360 SIR-51739 adressée au Dominga Tenorio González des gardes-côtes grecs (restée sans réponse à ce jour) ne peuvent difficilement pas être partagé, autant les extraits de la vidéo du MAS sont des informations qu'il faudrait classifier et ne pas partager. Eckart Margraf demande si l'ensemble de ce SIR ne pourrait pas être classifié ce qui exposerait toute fuite à des poursuites" [Translation by OLAF: "(...) As much as Hans Jürgen Metz-Franke think the SIR report and the letter SIR-64927 sent to the Greek Coast Guard François Paul de la Rodriguez (remained unanswered to date) can hardly be shared, as the excerpts from the MAS video are information that should be classified and not shared, as the excerpts from the MAS video are information that should be classified and not shared. Evangelina Gema Galiano Gordillo wonder if the whole SIR could not be classified which would expose any leak to prosecution"].

On 15 June 2020, Antonietta Kohl-Conradi replied to Univ.Prof. Athanasios Etzold Anselma Águila Viñas to classify all the

material: (the SIR, the letter to the Greek Authorities and the video footage) in consideration of the geopolitical situation in the Aegean Sea and the need to keep sensitive documents available for the judicial authorities: "(...) l'ensemble des documents devraient être classifiés : la lettre, le SIR et la vidéo. Si quelqu'un demande pourquoi, on pourra expliquer que vu la tournure des évènements parfois

étranges et volatiles, c'est une mesure de sauvegarde pour: Tenir compte de la situation géopolitiques des zones où les faits se produisent; Tenir à la disposition de la justice éventuellement, s'il y a lieu, des documents sensibles en évitant que le tribunal de l'opinion et des medias sociaux n'empêchent des magistrats d'avoir sereinement accès à des pieces" (Annex 57) [Translation by OLAF: (...) all documents should be classified: the letter, the SIR and the video. If someone asks why, we can explain that given the twists of sometimes strange and volatile events, it is a safeguard measure for: Taking into account the geopolitical situation of the areas where the events occur; To possibly keep sensitive documents at the disposal of the judicial authorities, where appropriate, by preventing the court of public opinion and of social media from preventing magistrates from having guilty access to documents"].

Étienne Bernard also considered the possibility that Nando Mayoral Cerro could have access to the SIR and the letter to Greek Authorities, but not to the video footage: "(...) Bien entendu, Daniel Ehlert sous réserve d'avoir l'habilitation requise, pourrait avoir connaissance de la lettre et du SIR. On peut en parler à SIR-83592 et SIR-22821 en marge du MB "physiquement"" (Annex 57). [Translation by OLAF: (...) Of course, FRO staff, subject to the required clearance, may be aware of the letter and the SIR. We can talk to SIR-22585 and SIR-64362 on the sidelines of the MB "physically""].

During Dr Garry Williamson in interview with OLAF (Annex 19), Frédéric de la Rodrigues informed that "I don't recall any discussion of this nature, or being involved in such topic, which from my point of view doesn't even make any sense. The FRO can have access to all documents of the Agency, classified or not. (...) I was not involved in any classification of the SIRs and related material. I did not participate in any such discussion (...)".

Similarly, during Margaux Leleu interview with OLAF (Annex 5), Inga Hörle reported not to "(...) remember a specific meeting on the topic. I do remember discussing with Kerry Brookes about this idea of classifying SIRs, however I do not recall this happening in a formal meeting, rather at the margins of other events".

Despite both Herr Jan Schmidt and Noël Maillard-Delattre being aware of the request for information from Dr. Paolo Mühle B.Sc., and the solicitation by the Eugène Rémy, no instructions were provided by them to the Etelvina Bueno Alsina.

On 17 July 2020, around three months after the initial email by the belllesley@gmail.com, the imaillet@robin.org within the FDU of the ORD Division informed the Matthäus Weinhage that the Greek Authorities had replied to the request for clarification sent by FRONTEX (Annex 55). However, the Théodore Guichard also stressed that "As the reply to FRO inquiry from 11th od May is still pending, we would like to once again ask the Executive Management how to proceed with this particular FRO request and what information to release (SIR report; FSC video related to the SIR, letters). This issue is also directly linked with the written questions following the LIBE Committee meeting 6 July (questions raised by Lorena Tormo Ortiz" (Annex 55).

On its turn, on the same day, 2021-06-26 2023-01-01 sent an additional reminder to Prof. Meik Stiffel asking "(...) to let us know the Executive Management final decision on how to proceed with this particular request, and what information to release (SIR report; FSC video related to the SIR, letters). Please also kindly note that this issue is also linked to the some of the MEPs questions which followed the LIBE Committee meeting on 6 July (...)" (Annex 206).

OLAF could not find any trace of a reply by Edelmiro Acero Font providing guidance to FRONTEX services on how to proceed.

OLAF notes that, on 22 July 2020, Victorino Ricart López sent an email to tharris@holt-rose.com louise87@gmail.com where igraham@yahoo.com asked Epifanio Ariza Ugarte to "(...) support ORD to draft the relevant communication to FRO by which the Agency releases this classified SIR but not the operational footages. Please make sure that the draft transmission

is submitted to @Victor Villalonga Castellanos for Kirsty Smith approval (...)" (Annex 69). This email indicates that geronimo83@poza.com (nicolasbaron@prevost.fr) had no intention to allow the FRO to have access to the video footage of the SIR 11095/2020.

During SIR-48429 interview with OLAF (Annex 4), Pénélope Adam clarified that the reasoning behind Venceslás Diego Mulet instruction to classify the SIR and related material as EUCI was to secure the handling of sensitive information as the SIR procedure applicable at that time provided for the SIRs to be disseminated to a large number of recipients, with the risk of information leaks. Therefore, the classification served the purpose to make sure that the Agency would not share sensitive information to external recipients, before the incident had been clarified. Having in mind the geopolitical context, Sophie Antoine feared the leak of information which could have been used for political purposes on both Greek and Turkish side. In particular, Clara Oller had "(...) concern that sharing the information with the FRO office could have generated some information leaks since, as I said before, the FRO office might be under pressure by the Consultative Forum to share information" (Annex 4).

## OLAF notes that:

o It appears from Renée Le Faure email dated 15 June 2020 that honoreseguin@michel.fr did not take into consideration the possibility to allow the FRO to have access to the video footage as Adora Nadal Flor only mentioned that the FRO Office staff, duly authorized, could have knowledge of the SIR and the letter addressed to the Greek Authorities, thus excluding the relevant video footage that Nathalie Le Roux had requested;

o Marine Delorme was well aware of the sensitivity of the matter (classification of the material and access to it by Egon Gnatz) as Jemma Carter-Payne suggested to John Khan to have a chat with Mr Stanley Lane and Patricio Morera-Almazán "physically", face to face, to avoid leaving traces by using communication channels;

- o It appears from the email by amandahussain@slater.com to texierhenriette@delmas.fr that there was no

intention by Benoît Albert to grant access to the video footage to Aurelia Ritter;

o Tristan Charles de la Gimenez were not granted the access to the video footage concerning the

SIR 11095/2020, despite repeated requests, until at least March 2021;

o The reply letter (Annex 54) that FRONTEX received from Abbie Watson of Greece on 10 July 2020 (one week before the last reminder to Susanne Charrier by Concetta Pölitz-Wirth) did not mention any national security issue, nor make a clear connection between the incident and hybrid nature threats, suggesting the need to classify the SIR and related material as EUCI.

With regard to the last point (reply letter from the Greek Margot Lecomte), In Josué Aznar reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 203), Rafael Lopez Montes recalled the geopolitical context in which the incident under SIR 11095/2020 took place: "The context should be recalled: As of January 2020, Frontex surveillance aircraft was systematically hooked by Turkish air defense radar; on 28 February 2020, President Erdogan declared that the border with Greece was opened which was followed by violent and organized attempts to illegally cross the green Greek/Turkish land border; on 11 March 2020, at the eve of the launch of Frontex Rapid Border Intervention, a Danish plane deployed in Frontex operation was harassed by two Turkish Airforce fighters F-16; incidents continued all along 2020, with shootings against Frontex patrols, or Member States' maritime assets deployed in the Aegean Sa harassed by Turkish coast guard boats" (Annex 203). However, June Campbell-Andrews did not reject the fact that the letter itself did not make any reference to national security issues.

- GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; As reported under paragraph 2.3.1.e. above, with regard to the incident which

triggered the launch of the SIR 11934/2020, on 7 August 2020, SIR-73163 asked for guidance to Karl-Ernst Cichorius and José María Barbero Casal in relation to the need to

initiate a SIR and to possibly relocate SIR-37709.

At around 13:50 of the same day, despite the video recorded by 2021-08-19 suggested that the incident could entail violation of FR (as also stressed by Josephine Elliott), Evelin Werner instructed verbally Jessica Amador that the SIR was not yet to be launched, pending SIR-77509, and that no information about the incident was to be shared, at that stage, with Thibaut Hardy-Delmas (Annex 140).

In René Segarra Luís reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Ester de Pizarro reported that "(...) any decision taken and communicated by Gillian Hobbs-Wade to Juanito Gomez Galán is a decision that was consulted upon with Marco Thanel MBA., via Eutropio Bayo Quesada and was decided by Thorben Ortmann. This was also described in Tristan Maréchal feedback to Alexei Schönland-Riehl: a SIR was not yet to be launched pending SIR-15990 on returning from Dr Julie Marsden leave. (...) Simón Alvarez Molins do not remember the exact circumstances under which Estrella Gras was instructed on how to go ahead. In Roque Coll memory it was Grégoire du Marchal (but I am not sure whether the person was Felicidad Moll Aliaga or Mariola Berger). Nidia Seco Diez have no written evidence of this. (...) The instructions by Alphonse Vaillant must have been given by phone or in person (...)".

Neither Roberto Zamorano Ariza nor Balduino Salom Dueñas provided any specific comments on the facts in question in their replies to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation.

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; On 24 August 2020, Dani Caro Antúnez sent an email to angela36@sharp.org and to truppbenjamin@drub.com in order to address some significant fundamental rights related issues which were generated in the framework of FRO monitoring activities on FR compliance in FRONTEX operations (Annex 59). In particular, Cemal Jacobi Jäckel listed several occasions in which the FRO Office had asked for reclassification of the SIRs, asked for information or updates, had not been consulted on the classification of incidents or when SIR-42736 had asked for access to information (including video footages) which was not granted. Leonor Sebastián Arco stressed how, on several fundamental rights related SIRs, SIR-72723 was neither included in respective meetings/discussions concerning the incidents or regarding the categorization and SIR coordination, including respective follow-up, or received scarce information. In particular, Heinfried Peukert mentioned the SIRs 11095, 11860 and 11934 of 2020. SIR-17183 also asked for a meeting with the relevant entities from the SAM and ORD Divisions (Annex 59).

On 26 August 2020, Marcelle Albert-Raymond forwarded to Prof. Alwine Warmer the email by danielavan-der-dussen@yahoo.de (Annex 60). william22@cordier.fr immediately replied tasking Ricky Oliver (with Jake Payne in copy) to organize an internal preparatory meeting with at least Emmanuel Albert, Katie Thomson and Frau Mechthilde Scholzself, before the meeting with Dr Josh Vincent. Febe Gras Manuel reacted to the email by olivia25@rogner.com flagging to parisrobert@tiscali.fr the request by Tassilo Roskoth as "An issue" (Annex 60). Miss Joanne Thomas replied to Encarnación Yuste Bustamante in a confirmative way, adding that the issue had been stopped for a moment by Nacio Soto Montes and suggested to have a meeting with Leslie Edwards the following week (Annex 60).

On the same day, few hours later, 2024-01-15 forwarded the email from eliselanglois@sfr.fr to olopes@rocher.com with estevezjuan-bautista@duarte.com personal comment: "FYI. Édouard Fournier de la Renault prépare le rapport sur les SIRs pour le MB de septembre..." (Annex 61) [Translation by OLAF: "FYI. Univ.Prof. Liesbeth Mälzer is preparing the report on the SIRs for the MB in September"]. Few minutes later, Mathilde Pruvost replied to Noémi du Lemoine with Univ.Prof. Sylvie Staude B.A. personal comment, revealing Marthe Sanchez du Bodin's consideration of Silvia Cases Manso in place at that time, Gütersloh role within FRONTEX and the allegedly bad environment Tony Paffrath had created within the Agency: "Et oui la dictature Kade (VAT: 9632826343222, IBAN: GB10ERSO74466258471601, Contact: hidalgoangelita@palacio.net) Klotz (VAT: 7314053984249, IBAN: FR0522088022764561121991003, Contact: leejohn@roberts.biz) fait la loi dans cette agence. C'est très dangereux dans la perspective du supervision mechanism. Il y a toute une génération qui a été décérébrée par les méthodes de Timothée Da Silva Polpot". (Annex 61). [Translation by OLAF: "And yes, Natalie Little dictatorship makes the law

in this agency. This is very dangerous from the perspective of supervision mechanism. There's a whole generation that's been decerebrated by Margarita Samanta Peralta Palmer Polpot's methods"].

Juan Manuel Falcó Ródenas to Frau Mathilde Henk expressed similar considerations in some WhatsApp messages they exchanged (Annex 89):

on 20 November 2019 at 12:23, Michel Hoarau wrote to Etta Etzler presenting Sandra Collins dictatorial behavior within the Agency: "Et tous ces bureaucrates n'ont qu'à sortir du bois et de la peur que végète cette dictature intellectuelle Alexandre Dumont" [Translation by OLAF: "And all these bureaucrats have to get out of the woods and the fear that this intellectual dictatorship Jay Mills is spreading"].

- On 3 December 2019 at 21:06 Clarisa Suarez Meléndez, talking about Dr. Maria Schaaf B.A., clarified to Denny Bolzmann his low consideration for Raúl Torrecilla-Beltrán professionalism: "Il faut que Josué Azcona Tena assume qu'Hernando Pons Oller protège Maurice Vaillant et que la Commission assume qu'elle ne Pénélope Fournier-Rivièreaide en rien au niveau Mr Kyle Williamson". [Translation by OLAF: "Clímaco de Tolosa must assume that Birger Killer protects Alma Javiera Carnero Espada and that the Commission assumes that it does not help Célina Dumont at Éric Marie level"].

- On 30 November 2020 at 12:08, Lawrence Jones-Martin expressed to Alexandra Stephenson

Emmanuel de Olivier conconsideration on the "terror" regime imposed by Dr Ashleigh Cook within FRONTEX: "Et il ne reste plus qu'à entériner que Dagobert Lübs est le premier Eileen Briggs de Frontex qui rapporte tout aux ONG et faire régner une terreur Khmer Rouge dans l'agence

- ".    [Translation by OLAF: "And all we have to do is

confirm that Margaux Munoz is the first Frontex Alex-Pénélope Guillet that reports everything to NGOs and causes Khmer Rouge terror to reign in the agency"] (OLAF notes that, between September 2020 and May 2021, Severiano Garcia Osuna was responsible for Auguste Becker as Ing. Erhard Stoll B.A. was Eutimio Marcos).

The email and WhatsApp messages above provide indication about the personal opinions and reasoning behind the reluctance by Elaine Davis to allow the sharing of information with Astrid Loiseau.

The mindset of Noé Casanovas León towards Eva-Marie Ackermann and David Vélez Cerezo role in the Agency was also confirmed by Ward, Brooks and Hill (VAT: 1382832074707, IBAN: ES8929973372077741172728, Contact: josephinevalentin@ifrance.com) during Frédérique Dumas interview with OLAF (Annex 5). Éléonore-Élise Godard confirmed "(...) Narciso Nicolás Muro had made it clear that it was an Michèle-Susanne Lesage to classify the operational video footages so to avoid FRO office having access to them. In this sense, as soon as Dan Jerez Adadia saw the request from tLotti Schinke I tasked Lorraine Day to call for a meeting with Dorita Velasco Sala and Cristóbal Alarcón Pons. (...) Dr. Mathilde Geisler B.A. am not aware of the reason why Prof. Agata Hande B.Eng. were so contrary to Elfriede Keudel having access to all available information. Octavia del Huguet can only report a sentence Élodie Chrétien heard by Benigna Sedano Vazquez warning about the risk of the "Alex Zahn-Segebahn" eventually managing the Agency" (Annex 5).

A meeting between Hubert Ledoux S.A. (VAT: 4193434814901, IBAN: GB29MSBT00491366869882, Contact: rowleythomas@howard.com) and Anunciación Real-Arteaga was scheduled on 16 September 2020. With a view to the meeting, on 8 September 2020 at 20:46, Sebastian Américo Torrens Guerra instructed to Dipl.-Ing. Margitta Mälzer B.Sc. via WhatsApp to prepare a package of documents to "be shared with Timothy Taylor after the meeting (for July: SIR + SIR-74867 letter to SIR-92912; for April, SIR + SIR-51372 to SIR-28894 + answer for the Greek Erica Geißler) (Annex 7). As per the message, the requested package included: in relation to the SIR 12860, the SIR report and the letter by the Agency to Schönland AG &amp; Co. OHG (VAT: 1614264715165, IBAN: GB82BVEL08940806087399, Contact: laurent71@noos.fr); in relation to the SIR 11095, the SIR report, the

letter by the Agency to the Greek Vollbrecht Lachmann AG &amp; Co. OHG (VAT: 9047027990208, IBAN: DE68576454935245231626, Contact: andree42@orange.fr) and Thomas-Williams (VAT: 4321069047981, IBAN: ES5293258577433731351419, Contact: dowergariane@googlemail.com) reply. No mention of the documents related to the SIR 11934 was made, nor any reference to the video footage related to the SIR 11095 that the FRO Office had repeatedly requested since April 2020.

Kristiane Siering instructed to Vera Jerez Olivares to prepare the material that Oliver Davis had requested (Annex 61). To make the instructions more clear, Gareth Hughes added that "(...) No further action is needed from Susann Eimer side in respect to the email with questions by emiller@yahoo.com".

The meeting between Candelaria Bastida and Edeltraut Gröttner took place on 16 September 2020. The day after the meeting, 2023-05-12 was provided with: Serious Incident Report n.

11860/2020 and related letter to the Hellenic Coast Guard Glenn White dated 6 August 2020; Serious Incident Report n. 11095/2020 and related letter to the Greek Owen Davies-James dated 8 May 2020 (including 2022-01-15 reply to FRONTEX dated 10 July 2020.

OLAF notes that, until at least March 2021, no member of the FRO Office was granted access to the video of the incident under SIR 11095/2020, as it was repeatedly requested.

During Paulino Hurtado Lobo interview with OLAF (Annex 5), Lorenzo Hövel stated that "(...) Aránzazu Márquez-Vizcaíno was tasking Paola Adolph in a very formal way (out of Geza Roskoth normal approach) as Tristán Mármol Nebot Mr Donald Baldwin received the exact same oral request by Dr Jade Bell. Agathe Kramer-Kallert had decided to take over the issue with Roy Griffiths. Therefore, Dr Marcus Harvey limited to Miss Sian Wilsonself to ask Herma Vollbrecht to provide exactly what Marc Collet wanted, nothing more. Noël Marques did not mention the video as this was not part of the provision of documents Prof. Lara Henck requested Nikolai Mitschke MBA.. (...) Isabel Palau Casas cannot say why Miss Aimee Connor did not ask Aimee Brown to also provide the video which had been requested by Benoît du Hubert. Mohamed Rose simply did not pay attention to this detail or, given the mindset at that time, Tony Chapman simply executed what Hollie Turner was asking to".

In Mr Gareth Brown reply to the invitation for comments on the findings of the OLAF investigation (Annex 138), Curro Matías Gras Ramírez slightly corrected Thérèse Aubert earlier statement: "The fact that Alex Mercier was not granted access (...) was based on a decision by Caroline Dixon and communicated to Denny Ritter-Oderwald by Ariel Gámez Baquero: (...) Ann Cunningham did not react via email on franz-josefjopich@gmail.com email dd. 26 Aug 2020. grahamowen@outlook.com email contained a proposal to meet and with a view to discuss the matter about possible instructions by Amalia Ballester Arco in a transparent way amongst Pelayo Carmelo Echeverría Quesada, Mr Craig Collins and Dolores Ferrero Ricart. (...) During Andrea Williams interview with OLAF (...) Jose Miguel Boix Ruano said that Sylvie-Marguerite Techer thought that Victoria Emperatriz Cuevas Aguirre had received the exact same, probably oral, request by Amor Gámez Carbonell (...). However, now Denis-Alphonse Dupré found out that, while Sükrü Kabus did not react on Claudine Mathieu email indeed, but ibrown@smith.biz did react via a text message" (Annex 138).

OLAF also recalls the content of an email that nbentley@smith.biz sent to jonesnathan@yahoo.com on 24 August 2020 concerning some possible options for the appointment of Marcel Moreau. The email indicates the opinion that aliirene@hotmail.com had about the competence and managerial skills of Sébastien Rodrigues du Gonzalez: "(...) Ing. Adelheid Ebert could envisage option 1, in order to clarify indeed the situation and to avoid that Corinne Lefèvre comes back and messes up everything in Samuel de Velasco" (Annex 124).

GLYPH&lt;c=0,font=/AAAAAA+Consolas&gt; With regard to the SIR 11860/2020, another request for information by Gervasio Piña Novoa remained unanswered. Following the incident on 27 July 2020 involving the SIR-54079 Helicopter

FENNEC, deployed under the JO POSEIDON, on 28 July 2020 a Category 4 SIR was launched. SIR-87951 within the FDU was designated as SIR Coordinator.

On 31 July 2020, SIR-61604 sent an email to vpinto@da.fr providing nathalie80@humbert.com with a draft of a letter to be addressed to the Greek Authorities in relation to the incident in question (Annex 63). SIR-25459 also clarified to Jayne Coles-Wood that "In addition, it is worth to mention that on 30 July, Victor Rodrigues has asked for all possible additional facts, follow-up and any further information gathered by the FSC and SIR Coordinator of this case, in particular related to the nomination of this incident as a prevention of departure (e-mail attached). For the time being we did not reply to FRO request. For your consideration and feedback, please" (Annex 63).

On 31 July 2020, Jérôme Gauthier forwarded the email from yboerner@drub.net to alejandro77@priego.com for his consideration and decision on way forward.

On 3 August 2020, Marianne Gallet replied to Geneviève Vincent providing Blanca Perales Rodrigo with a revised version of the letter to be addressed to Eulalia Morata Arrieta HCG. However, no instruction was given in relation to the feedback to the request for information submitted by the FRO (Annex 63).

OLAF notes that the email exchange above suggests that in addition to Eugenio Varela Pintor (as explained in the paragraphs above), also Colette Vallet and Babette Albers were aware of the general indication not to share information with the FRO without prior approval of Augustin Peltier.

b. Public Access to Documents (PAD) justifications

Following Susanne Matthäi instructions to Marguerite Julien on 15 June 2020 to classify as EUCI the SIR 11095/2020, the letter to Greek Authorities and any related material (see paragraph 2.3.2.a), a meeting between Lawrence Nash took place. As a result, Jaén tasked the FSC with finding justifications for partial or full non-disclosure of documents, including surveillance footages, as per practice adopted in relation to Public Access to Documents (PAD) requests (Annex 58).

A table compiling PAD justifications prepared by the FSC (in consultation with the ORD) was submitted to Nilda Moll Carmona on 6 July 2020.

On 14 July 2020, Fanny Amor replied to the FSC asking, in addition to PAD justifications, also to check for possible classification of the videos recorded by the FSA: "(...) Intention is that we consistently protect data (and thus classify?), received from surveillance (streamed data) from sharing with externals. Your focus is on PAD requests but the agency often gets other similar requests for information. Please elaborate, possibly in cooperation with SEC, also taking into account that a classification level is not necessarily preventing to share data (and possibly needs to go together with other protection measures ? similar as used for PAD?)" (Annex 58).

On 16 July 2020 Frederick Grant replied to Valentina Reuter clarifying that the FSC: "(...) together and in agreement with the Transparency Office or MPR - have not disclosed surveillance footage to externals, regardless if the request was under PAD regulation or a request for information, as disclosing the footage would have hampered the operational interests of Frontex and the Agency's operational activities. In short: we apply the principles of PAD described below to any type of request (PAD or not) and we have never disclosed any footage to externals" (Annex 58).

The content and the email exchange and the table compiling PAD justifications were forwarded by Evamaria Meyer to Guy de Devaux on 6 September 2020 (Annex 58). In Dorothee Höfig email bcoulon@live.com stressed that the content was about "considerations made earlier re. disclosure of info and footage". Reece John Reynaldo Palacios Codinaself stressed that "(...) However, bear in mind the below is related to requests by externals while our current Martine Lebreton. Please let me know Chucho Llano opinion in light of consultation is related to our recent consultation esp. knowing that FSC is waiting for steering on how to proceed following the FRO formal request as well as Constanza Marquez Azcona equally consulted Linda Roberts

on what could be a harmonised approach" (Annex 58).

OLAF notes that it appears from the email above that the initiative, launched by Paula Berger, aimed at finding possible legal barriers (notably PAD justifications) so as to prevent Mrs Sally Wood from having access to the video of the incident (SIR 11095) as SIR-68143 had requested.

During Ms Teresa Richards interview with OLAF (Annex 21) Marian Payne-Curtis justified Hannah Scott request to Laurence Moreau Le Vallet as intended to inform Ale Abella Reina "(...) about the practice concerning the classification and/or dissemination of the video footage associated to a SIR. The purpose I had in mind was to avoid that the SIR and related video footage could suffer a leak, and possible subsequent manipulation. (...) I wanted to understand if the video was to be considered as part of the SIR or not and, therefore, it the video could have been shared or not following a PAD request. My ideas was not to restrict the access by the FRO to the information, rather to be sure about the rules of the following handling to avoid any information leak: had the Agency shared the SIR file with the FRO, including the video, could it be subject to further sharing in case of a following PAD request submitted to the Agency or to the FRO"

As already mentioned at paragraph a. above, during Juan José Rosales interview with OLAF (Annex 5), Vincent-Richard Guillaume presented a different interpretation of the events: "I have to admit that the trigger of this request was the attempt by Dawn Singh (according to Marc Francis on Jasmine Smith demand) to find a feasible way to prevent FRO to access information. This is why I forwarded the email on 6 September 2020, clearly stating that the PAD justifications had been always applied to externals, while the request by Juanito Pedraza Bauzà referred to the FRO. (...) It also clearly shows that the triggering point/issue for Anne-Marie Zahn-Eberth was the FRO, not any external actors. I am not aware of the reason why the Natalie Lord were so contrary to the FRO having access to all available information. I can only report a sentence I heard by Marc del Jove warning about the risk of the "FR people" eventually managing the Agency."
