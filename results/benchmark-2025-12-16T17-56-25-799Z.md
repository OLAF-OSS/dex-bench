**Purpose and Problem Statement**  
Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper introduces *Bitcoin*, an electronic cash system that eliminates the need for a trusted third‑party financial institution.  It builds on publicly verifiable digital signatures to create a chain of ownership for each coin, but recognizes that such a system alone cannot prevent **double‑spending**.  The solution proposed is to use a *peer‑to‑peer distributed timestamp server* that records all transactions in an irreversible, time‑ordered ledger.

**Core Mechanism: Proof‑of‑Work Chain**  
The network hashes blocks of newly broadcast transactions and solves a computationally expensive proof‑of‑work (SHA‑256 nonce search).  The longest hash chain, which therefore carries the greatest cumulative proof‑of‑work, is accepted as the authoritative history.  Because altering any block would recompute all subsequent proof‑of‑work, the chain becomes practically immutable once it is sufficiently deep (typically 10–min blocks in the paper; ~6 per hour).  Honest nodes, controlling the majority of CPU power, outpace any malicious minority attempting to construct a competing chain.

**Network, Incentive & Practicalities**  
Nodes operate without central coordination:  
1) Broadcast transactions.  
2) Gather them into a block.  
3) Mine proof‑of‑work.  
4) Broadcast the block.  
5) Accept blocks that contain only unspent, valid transactions.  
The miner that publishes the first transaction in a block receives a *coinbase* block reward, thus providing an incentive to maintain the network and a mechanism to introduce new coins without a central mint.  Transaction fees can later supplant block rewards, yielding an inflation‑free system.  Merkle trees prune spent inputs and keep block headers small (~80 bytes), while simplified payment verification allows lightweight clients to trust the chain by downloading only headers and Merkle branches.

**Security Analysis & Conclusion**  
Mathematical modeling (a binomial random‑walk/Gambler’s‑Ruin analysis) shows that the probability an attacker can catch up with a chain that is *z* blocks ahead falls exponentially with *z*, assuming honest nodes control the majority of hashing power.  Practical thresholds (e.g., 5–10 blocks for 99.9 % certainty when an attacker has 10 % of the hashing power) make double‑spending attacks computationally infeasible.  

By combining cryptographic signatures, a majority‑powered proof‑of‑work consensus, and miner incentives, Bitcoin achieves a robust, self‑sustaining peer‑to‑peer electronic cash system that requires no trusted intermediaries and limits the damage from hostile actors.

**Overview**

The paper introduces the **Transformer**, a neural architecture for sequence transduction that relies solely on attention mechanisms—removing recurrent and convolutional layers entirely. By stacking six identical encoder and decoder layers, each with a multi‑head self‑attention sub‑layer followed by a position‑wise feed‑forward network, the model obtains strong parallelism, constant‑time path lengths, and improved learning of long‑range dependencies. The authors also embed sine‑cosine positional encodings and employ residual connections and layer‑normalization to stabilize training.

**Core Contributions and Results**

1. **Attention‑only Design**  
   - Multi‑head attention (8 heads, d_k = d_v = 64) feeds forward into a 512‑dimensional space; each layer’s outputs are shortcut‑connected and normalised.  
   - Scaled dot‑product attention reduces gradient vanishing at large dimensionalities.  
   - Self‑attention replaces recurrent dependencies, enabling O(1) sequential operations per layer.

2. **Training Regimen**  
   - Optimised with Adam (β1=0.9, β2=0.98, ε=1e‑9), warm‑up 4000 steps, label‑smoothing (ε_ls=0.1), and dropout (p_drop=0.1 for base, 0.3 for big).  
   - Models trained on 8 × P100 GPUs: the base model (~100 k steps, 12 h) and the larger variant (~300 k steps, 3.5 d).  

3. **Machine Translation Performance**  
   - **English→German**: Big Transformer achieves **BLEU 28.4** on WMT’14 newstest2014, surpassing every prior single‑model or ensemble (e.g., ConvS2S 25.16, GNMT+RL 24.6).  
   - **English→French**: Big Transformer reaches **BLEU 41.8**, beating all single‑model baselines (ConvS2S 40.46, Deep‑Att 39.2).  
   - Training costs are markedly lower: ~3 × 10¹⁸ FLOPs for the base versus ~2 × 10¹⁹ for the big model, compared to ~9 × 10¹⁸ for ConvS2S.

4. **Model Variants and Ablations**  
   - Experiments (Table 3) confirm that multi‑head attention is essential; reducing heads degrades BLEU by ~0.9.  
   - Larger dimension sizes (d_model 1024, d_ff 4096) and higher dropout (0.3) improve performance.  
   - Sine‑cosine positional encoding offers comparable results to learned embeddings.

5. **Generalisation to Other Tasks**  
   - A 4‑layer Transformer (d_model = 1024) on the Penn Treebank WSJ parsed constituency trees with F₁ ≈ 92.7, rivaling state‑of‑the‑art RNN‑grammars and surpassing earlier sequence‑to‑sequence parsers when trained only on 40 k sentences.

**Conclusion**

The Transformer demonstrates that attention alone can replace RNNs and CNNs in encoder‑decoder architectures, delivering faster training, better parallelism, and high‑accuracy results on machine translation and parsing benchmarks. The release of the accompanying code base (Tensor2Tensor) encourages broader adoption and adaptation to other modalities.

**Purpose & Scope**  
The investigation, opened by OLAF on 30 April 2021 and split from an earlier case (OC/2020/0866/A1), focused on potential misconduct and irregularities within the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (FRONTEX). It examined allegations that FRONTEX, its managers and staff had been involved in or had covered up illegal push‑backs of migrants, suppressed fundamental‑rights monitoring, misused procurement and recruitment procedures, and failed to follow established protocols in incident reporting and operational conduct. The investigation gathered information from FRONTEX documents, the European Commission, open‑source material, witness interviews, digital forensic analyses, and internal communications.

**Key Findings**  
OLAF found that several senior FRONTEX officials—including Klaus‑Michael Staude, Joachim Ring, Basilio Villena‑Carbajo, Reece Morgan, Günther Heser, Martine Collet, Arthur Allain, Andrey Wirth, Edwin Mentzel, and others—failed to comply with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on Serious Incident Reporting (SIR), deliberately excluded the Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) from key investigations, and obstructed the FRO’s access to information. Their actions enabled possible illegal push‑backs, limited the Agency’s ability to monitor and protect fundamental rights, and jeopardised compliance with EU and international law. Investigators documented that several SIRs (e.g., 11022/2020, 11095/2020, 11934/2020, 11860/2020) were misclassified or omitted, with FRO oversight improperly excluded, leading to inadequate follow‑up and no meaningful engagement with host member states or the European Court of Auditors. Instances of internally transmitted reports, e‑mail exchanges, and procedural neglect reinforced that the agency’s management had deliberately sidestepped its legal duties, including Article 46 of the 2019 FRONTEX Regulation and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

**Legal and Financial Impact**  
The alleged misconduct constitutes breaches of the Staff Regulation for EU officials, the FRONTEX Code of Conduct, and the EU regulations governing the agency. The investigation estimates serious financial exposure due to unspent or misallocated funds, though the precise figure remains pending. OLAF highlighted that these irregularities could expose FRONTEX to civil liability for violating the principle of non‑refoulement, the duty to assist persons in distress under UNCLOS, and the EU’s fundamental‑rights framework. Failure to address the incidents promptly contributed, in OLAF’s view, to a reputational risk for FRONTEX and a weakening of public trust in EU border management.

**Conclusions & Recommendations**  
OLAF concludes that the misconduct amounts to serious misbehaviour that undermines FRONTEX’s mandate to safeguard fundamental rights and to operate within legal boundaries. The report recommends a comprehensive overhaul of FRONTEX’s SOPs on incident reporting, mandatory inclusion of the FRO in all SIR processes, transparent procedures for handling potential push‑back cases, and stronger accountability mechanisms for senior officials. It also urges immediate engagement with affected Member States to address potential violations and to explore remedial actions under Article 46, as well as a review of procurement and recruitment practices to eliminate conflicts of interest.

)Here's a comprehensive yet concise summary of the Bitcoin whitepaper:

The Bitcoin whitepaper proposes a novel peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminates the need for trusted third parties like banks to facilitate online transactions. The core innovation addresses the "double-spending" problem—preventing the same digital coin from being spent multiple times—through a distributed network that timestamps transactions and chains them together using a "proof-of-work" system, similar to Hashcash. This proof-of-work requires computational effort, making it increasingly difficult to alter past transactions as more blocks are added to the chain.  The network’s security rests on the assumption that honest nodes controlling a majority of the network’s computational power will maintain the longest, valid chain, making it economically infeasible for attackers to manipulate the system. The system incentivizes participation by rewarding nodes with newly created coins and transaction fees, analogous to gold mining.

The whitepaper details key aspects of the system, including transaction structures, a distributed timestamp server, network operation (transaction broadcasting, block creation, acceptance), and mechanisms for simplified payment verification. It also explores privacy considerations suggesting the use of new key pairs for each transaction and examines the probability of attackers successfully altering the transaction history.  Crucially, the paper concludes that this decentralized, trustless system provides a secure and robust framework for electronic payments, relying on cryptographic proof and economic incentives rather than centralized authority, and demonstrating an exponential decrease in the probability of successful attacks based on the number of blocks confirming a transaction.

## Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System - Summary

Satoshi Nakamoto’s whitepaper proposes a solution to the problem of establishing a purely peer-to-peer electronic cash system, eliminating the need for trusted third parties like banks. The core issue addressed is preventing “double-spending” – the risk that digital currency can be fraudulently spent multiple times. The proposed solution leverages a peer-to-peer network and a cryptographic timestamp server based on a “proof-of-work” system. Transactions are bundled into blocks, and nodes on the network compete to solve a complex computational problem (finding a nonce that, when hashed with the block data, results in a hash with a certain number of leading zeros).  The node that solves the problem gets to add the block to the blockchain, a continuously growing chain of blocks, and is rewarded with newly created coins. This proof-of-work mechanism ensures that modifying past transaction records requires redoing the work for all subsequent blocks, making it computationally infeasible for an attacker controlling less than 50% of the network's computing power.

The system’s security rests on the assumption that the majority of CPU power remains with honest nodes.  The longest chain is considered the valid history, and nodes readily accept the longest chain as consensus.  The paper details how the difficulty of the proof-of-work adjusts dynamically to maintain a consistent block generation rate.  Privacy is addressed through the use of new key pairs for each transaction, obscuring the link between transactions and owners, though not eliminating it entirely.  Furthermore, the system incentivizes participation through block rewards and transaction fees. The paper calculates the probability of a successful attack diminishes exponentially with each new block added to the chain, and illustrates that a relatively small number of confirmations (blocks added after a transaction) provides a high degree of security against reversal. Ultimately, Nakamoto’s design proposes a robust and decentralized system for secure electronic transactions relying solely on cryptographic proofs and distributed consensus rather than trust in a central authority.

## Summary of "Attention Is All You Need"

This paper introduces the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture for sequence transduction tasks like machine translation, that *entirely* relies on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions. The authors demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance, increased parallelization, and reduced training time compared to state-of-the-art recurrent and convolutional models. Key to the Transformer is its “scaled dot-product attention” and “multi-head attention” mechanisms, allowing the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing information. The architecture consists of stacked encoder and decoder layers, utilizing self-attention to capture relationships within and between sequences.

Experiments on English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks showed the Transformer achieving new state-of-the-art BLEU scores (28.4 and 41.8 respectively), surpassing existing models – even ensembles – with significantly reduced training costs. The paper also highlights the Transformer's generalizability, successfully applying it to English constituency parsing. The authors analyze the model's inner workings, noting that attention heads learn distinct behaviors, including capturing syntactic structure and resolving long-distance dependencies. They argue that self-attention reduces the path length for dependencies, addressing a key limitation of recurrent and convolutional approaches, pointing to promising avenues for future research in areas like handling larger inputs and exploring local attention mechanisms.  The code is publicly available, fostering further development and application of this novel architecture.

## OLAF Investigation OC/2021/0451/A1 - Summary

This final report details a sensitive OLAF investigation into allegations of misconduct and irregularities within the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (FRONTEX), initiated in October 2020 following information received concerning potential involvement in, or cover-up of, illegal pushbacks, as well as internal management issues. The investigation, spanning over a year, involved extensive data collection, including document review, interviews with 20 witnesses, and digital forensic analysis. Key findings reveal a pattern of serious misconduct by numerous FRONTEX personnel, categorized into failures to follow procedures, breaches of loyalty to the EU, and dereliction of managerial responsibilities. Specifically, individuals deliberately downplayed or concealed evidence of potential human rights violations – particularly regarding alleged pushbacks by Greek authorities – obstructed proper reporting mechanisms (Serious Incident Reports), and actively worked to limit the access of the Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) to critical information. 

The investigation uncovered a systematic effort to circumvent established protocols regarding incident reporting and fundamental rights monitoring.  Evidence suggests decisions were made, not based on legal or ethical considerations, but on geopolitical factors and a desire to avoid scrutiny, even to the point of manipulating information shared with the public and oversight bodies.  The report details incidents where FRONTEX assets were potentially involved in illegal activities and how internal attempts to investigate were stifled or redirected.  Notably, despite clear indications of potential violations, the investigation found a reluctance to engage the FRO, a lack of follow-up on concerning reports, and intentional misclassification of incidents to avoid triggering higher-level scrutiny. The report concludes that the identified failings hindered FRONTEX's ability to uphold its responsibilities related to fundamental rights and compliance with EU law, and highlights a concerning culture within the agency prioritizing operational efficiency over the protection of human rights.  Judicial proceedings are ongoing as a result of the investigation.

The document titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" by Satoshi Nakamoto proposes a decentralized electronic payment system that eliminates the need for trusted third-party financial institutions. The system leverages cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly. The key innovation is solving the double-spending problem through a peer-to-peer network that timestamps transactions using a chain of hash-based proof-of-work, ensuring that the transaction history cannot be altered without significant computational effort.

Nakamoto argues that traditional electronic payment systems, which rely on financial institutions, suffer from inherent weaknesses such as reversible transactions and high mediation costs. The proposed system uses digital signatures and a distributed timestamp server to create a public history of transactions. The network operates on a proof-of-work system where nodes compete to solve complex mathematical problems, with the longest chain of valid transactions representing the agreed-upon history. This mechanism ensures that as long as the majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the network remains secure.

The document outlines the structure and operation of the network, including how transactions are broadcast, collected into blocks, and validated through proof-of-work. It also discusses incentives for nodes to support the network, such as the creation of new coins and transaction fees. Privacy is maintained by keeping public keys anonymous, and the system includes mechanisms for simplified payment verification and efficient disk space management.

Nakamoto concludes that the proposed system provides a robust framework for electronic transactions without relying on trust, ensuring that the transaction history becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to alter if honest nodes control the majority of CPU power. The network's simplicity and lack of coordination among nodes contribute to its robustness and security.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system designed to enable direct, trustless transactions between parties without the need for financial intermediaries. The core challenge addressed is the double-spending problem, where a digital currency could be spent more than once. Traditional solutions rely on trusted third parties, but Bitcoin eliminates this dependency by using a decentralized, distributed timestamp server based on proof-of-work (PoW). Transactions are recorded in a public ledger (blockchain), where each block contains a hash of the previous block, forming an immutable chain. To add a block, nodes must solve a computationally intensive PoW puzzle—finding a nonce such that the block’s hash begins with a specified number of leading zeros. This ensures that altering a block requires redoing all subsequent PoW, making attacks prohibitively expensive. The longest chain, representing the greatest cumulative proof-of-work, is accepted as the valid history. Nodes broadcast transactions and blocks on a best-effort basis, and consensus is achieved through the majority of CPU power supporting the longest chain. To incentivize participation, new coins are created through block rewards (initially 50 BTC per block, halving every 210,000 blocks), later transitioning to transaction fees. The system supports simplified payment verification via Merkle trees, allowing lightweight clients to confirm transactions without storing the full blockchain. Privacy is preserved through pseudonymous public keys, with best practices recommending new key pairs per transaction. The paper mathematically demonstrates that the probability of an attacker catching up to the honest chain diminishes exponentially with each additional block, with a 0.1% probability of success requiring 5 blocks if the attacker controls 10% of the network hash rate. Ultimately, Bitcoin provides a trustless, censorship-resistant, and secure digital currency system, where consensus is achieved through computational effort and network participants act in their own economic interest to maintain the chain’s integrity.

Key components include scaled dot-product attention, positional encodings using sinusoidal functions to preserve sequence order, and residual connections with layer normalization. The model is evaluated through extensive ablation studies, showing the importance of multi-head attention, model size, and regularization. Furthermore, the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks, achieving competitive results on English constituency parsing, even without task-specific tuning.

Initiated in 2020, the investigation, case OC/2021/0451/A1, focused on the handling of serious incidents, particularly those involving the Hellenic Coast Guard (HCG) in the Aegean Sea, and the exclusion of the Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) from critical processes. The evidence, gathered through interviews, digital forensics, and analysis of internal communications, proves that FRONTEX management, including senior officials like Klaus-Michael Staude, Univ.Prof. Joachim Ring, and others, systematically violated the agency’s own Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) on Serious Incident Reporting (SIR). Key findings include the deliberate reclassification of incidents involving potential violations of fundamental rights (e.g., SIR 11095/2020 and SIR 11934/2020) from Category 4 (FRO-led) to Category 2 (non-FRO-led), the exclusion of the FRO from incident assessments and reporting, and the failure to initiate SIRs for credible allegations of illegal pushbacks. The report also details the relocation of the FSA METIS aircraft from the Aegean Sea, which OLAF concludes was done to avoid witnessing such incidents. Furthermore, the FRO’s access to information was severely restricted, with sensitive materials like video footage being classified to prevent the FRO from receiving it. The report concludes that these actions, driven by a desire to protect the agency’s reputation and manage geopolitical tensions, constituted serious misconduct, undermining FRONTEX’s core mandate to ensure respect for fundamental rights and compliance with EU law, particularly the principle of non-refoulement.

The document "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" by Satoshi Nakamoto introduces a novel electronic payment system that operates without the need for trusted third parties, such as financial institutions. The system leverages cryptographic proof to enable direct transactions between parties, addressing the double-spending problem through a peer-to-peer network. This network timestamps transactions by hashing them into a chain of proof-of-work, creating an immutable record. The longest chain, which represents the most computational effort, is considered the valid sequence of transactions.

The system's security relies on the majority of CPU power being controlled by honest nodes, ensuring that the honest chain grows faster than any attacker's chain. Transactions are broadcast to all nodes, collected into blocks, and validated through a proof-of-work process. The first transaction in a block is a special transaction that rewards the block creator with new coins, incentivizing participation and distributing coins into circulation. The system also allows for transaction fees to fund the incentive once a predetermined number of coins are in circulation.

The document details the network's operation, including how nodes accept and validate blocks, handle simultaneous block broadcasts, and manage dropped messages. It also discusses privacy measures, such as using anonymous public keys and generating new key pairs for each transaction. The system's robustness is highlighted by its ability to handle node departures and rejoins, with nodes accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as evidence of past events.

The document concludes by emphasizing the system's ability to facilitate electronic transactions without relying on trust, using a peer-to-peer network and proof-of-work to create a public history of transactions that is computationally impractical for attackers to alter. The network's simplicity and lack of coordination requirements contribute to its robustness, with nodes voting with their CPU power to accept valid blocks and reject invalid ones.

The paper "Attention Is All You Need" introduces the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture designed for sequence transduction tasks such as machine translation. Unlike traditional models that rely on recurrent or convolutional layers, the Transformer uses self-attention mechanisms exclusively, allowing for greater parallelization and faster training times. The authors demonstrate the Transformer's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art results on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, surpassing previous models in both performance and training efficiency. The Transformer's architecture consists of stacked self-attention and feed-forward layers, with multi-head attention enabling the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. The paper also explores the model's generalization capabilities by applying it to English constituency parsing, where it performs competitively with existing models. The authors conclude by highlighting the potential of attention-based models and their plans to extend the Transformer to other tasks and modalities.

The presented document, "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" by Satoshi Nakamoto, introduces a revolutionary concept for electronic transactions that eliminating the need for a trusted third party. Nakamoto proposes a peer-to-peer network utilizing proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions, making it computationally impractical for attackers to alter if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power. This system enables direct transactions between parties without the involvement of financial institutions, reducing the risk of fraud and increasing the efficiency of transactions. The network operates by collecting new transactions into blocks, which are then hashed and added to a chain. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, ensuring the integrity of the transaction history.

The system's security relies on the honesty of the majority of nodes, which vote with their CPU power to validate transactions and extend the chain. The proof-of-work mechanism ensures that an attacker would need significant computational power to alter the chain, making it impractical to do so. The document also discusses the potential for an attacker to attempt to create an alternate chain, but calculates that the probability of success decreases exponentially as the number of blocks increases. Additionally, the system allows for incentives, such as transaction fees and the creation of new coins, to encourage honest behavior and participation in the network. Overall, the proposed system offers a novel solution for secure, peer-to-peer electronic transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the risk of fraud. The author concludes that this system has the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct electronic transactions, providing a secure, efficient, and trustless platform for financial exchange.

The document introduces the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture based solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence and convolutions. The authors propose this new architecture as a replacement for traditional sequence transduction models, which typically rely on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks. The Transformer is composed of an encoder and a decoder, both of which consist of stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers. The model uses multi-head attention, which allows it to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions.

The Transformer achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, outperforming existing models on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. The big Transformer model achieves a BLEU score of 28.4 on the English-to-German task and 41.8 on the English-to-French task, surpassing the previous best results, including ensembles. The model also generalizes well to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing, where it achieves competitive results with minimal task-specific tuning. The authors attribute the success of the Transformer to its ability to parallelize computation, reducing the computational complexity and allowing for faster training times. They also highlight the importance of self-attention mechanisms in modeling long-range dependencies and providing interpretability. Overall, the Transformer represents a significant advancement in sequence transduction modeling, offering a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional architectures.

The document is a comprehensive report by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) on its investigation into alleged irregularities at the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (FRONTEX). The investigation was launched in response to allegations of possible misconduct and irregularities related to FRONTEX's involvement in illegal pushbacks of migrants at the EU's external borders. The report details the investigative activities carried out by OLAF, including the collection and analysis of information from open sources, inspections of FRONTEX premises, and interviews with witnesses. The investigation found evidence of serious misconduct and irregularities by FRONTEX staff, including the exclusion of the Fundamental Rights Officer (FRO) from the reporting line, intimidation and harassment of staff members, and possible conflict of interest in recruitment procedures.

The report highlights several incidents where FRONTEX assets were allegedly involved in pushbacks, and the Agency's handling of these incidents was found to be inadequate. In one incident, a FRONTEX surveillance aircraft detected a rubber boat with migrants being towed by a Greek Coast Guard vessel towards Turkish territorial waters. Despite the seriousness of the incident, the FRO was not informed, and the incident was not properly investigated. The report also found that FRONTEX staff had failed to follow procedures and protocols, and had prioritized maintaining good relations with the Greek authorities over ensuring the protection of fundamental rights. The OLAF investigation concludes that the alleged misconduct and irregularities are in breach of the Staff Regulation of Officials of the EU, the FRONTEX Code of Conduct, and the legal framework stipulated by the FRONTEX Regulations, and recommends that the Agency takes corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.
